We're asking women how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we're tracking every last dollar."", 'Are you playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons and want to show off your sweet digs?\xa0Send us a few pictures of your Animal Crossing home along with a description of your island for a chance to be featured in an upcoming story.\xa0Submit your pictures and story\xa0here\xa0using the subject line Animal Crossing Sweet Digs.Today: a teacher who makes $55,400 per year and spends some of her money this week on an essential oil diffuser.', 'Occupation: TeacherIndustry: EducationAge: 25Location: Tri-Cities, WASalary: $55,400Net Worth: -$83,000 (I have money in my savings account and in my retirement fund set up by my district but I have student loan debt and credit card debt. I have about $58,000 in student loans from my undergrad and masters combined (I just finished my masters two weeks ago so my loans are in deferment until December). I have about $26,000 in credit card debt which I accumulated mostly from being stupid in college and a little from actually needing stuff. I am currently ""snowballing"" my debt and have paid off about $6,000 in the last four months. If all goes as planned I will be credit card debt-free in the next 21 months!)

I wake up excited because today is payday and I am also expecting my edTPA score report. I brush my teeth, take my allergy pill, wash my face, and then do my regular morning skincare routine: Simple micellar water, Clean and Clear gel moisturizer, and Mario Badescu rose face spray. For breakfast, I warm up a frozen egg, bacon, and cheese burrito and also grab some vanilla greek yogurt, a banana, and some orange juice. I take my food back to my room and eat while I pay my bills. I am currently focusing on aggressively paying off the credit card debt I (stupidly) accrued in college so I look forward to payday each month so I can chip away at the debt. I am also saving up to get my own apartment this summer and I am excited to be able to put $700 into that account!', ""10:45 a.m. — After straightening my room and washing my breakfast dishes, I settle at my laptop to do some work and play an episode of Ozark in the background (haven't decided if I like it yet). I'm a teacher and our schools have now been closed for 45 days. I check my email and my Class Dojo and answer some questions from parents. I post a reminder for the Zoom meeting I am having tomorrow (fingers crossed my kids come!). I work in a low-income district and we cannot guarantee one-to-one access to devices and WiFi for all students, so we are not live-teaching. Instead, the district provides weekly packets that families can pick up at the school when they go pick up lunch and that I can send out through Class Dojo and email. I miss my kids so much so I am super excited about our call tomorrow."", ""12:30 p.m. — After I finish my work for the day, I pull out the two suitcases that are currently housing my spring and summer shoes because I need to switch them out with my boots. Not sure if I'll get to it today but at least if I have to stare at the suitcases, I can't keep pretending to forget. I cozy up in bed to read my book Tangerine by Edward Bloor. This book is for my classroom library but I like to read any new books before I add them so that I can tell my kids about them."", '2 p.m. — I browse online for a cute essential oil diffuser for my little sister who is turning 12 in a few weeks. I find one that has color-changing lights and I pick out five different oils so she can have some variety. $44.05', ""2:45 p.m. — I head to the kitchen to hang out with my sister while she cleans. While I'm putting a mini cheese pizza in the oven to snack on, I get a call from one of my professors and he lets me know I passed my edTPA! I'll get an official score report in my email by the end of the day but I am SO relieved! This was the last thing I was waiting on and I finally feel 100% done with my Masters in Teaching Degree! I text with the group of friends I made in my program to share the good news and we celebrate as much as we can since we can't go out for happy hour. I pull out some chicken and chicken sausage to defrost for dinner."", ""4:45 p.m. — I start working on dinner. I'm making a one-pot Cajun pasta dish. I'm not great at following recipes and we don't have everything it calls for so I kinda do my own thing and it ends up being super yummy! After we eat, I pack C. (sister's boyfriend) a serving for his lunch tomorrow (he is an essential employee and is working six days a week) and put the leftovers away in the fridge. I clean up the kitchen and then jump in the shower."", '7:45 p.m. — After my shower, I put on a pore strip, start my laundry, and put away the now-dry dinner dishes. I watch the first episode of Big Little Lies and decide I like it.', '9 p.m. — I join my sister and C. for dessert and we chat for a few minutes before they go to bed. I switch my laundry into the dryer and do my bedtime routine: brush teeth and light skincare (Simple micellar water, Beauty First Aid Repairing Cream, Mario Badescu rose face spray, Kylie Skin eye cream, and Laneige lip sleeping mask). I turn my TV off by 10 and read until I fall asleep.', 'Daily Total: $44.05', 'Day Two', '7 a.m. — My first ambitious alarm goes off but nope. Hit snooze.', '8 a.m. — I finally wake up and ease into my morning by checking my phone and email.', ""8:45 a.m. — I roll out of bed and do my makeup since I have a Zoom call with my students today. I have definitely not been wearing makeup during quarantine which has been great for my skin, but I look forward to the days when I can feel like my regular self. I do my full face (moisturizer, primer, foundation, concealer, setting powder, ABH brow pomade, mascara, bronzer, blush, highlighter, liquid lipstick, and setting spray), brush my hair, change into yoga pants, a t-shirt, and sneakers, and dump my clean laundry on my bed so I'm forced to put it away if I want to go to sleep tonight."", ""10 a.m. — I warm up the leftover pasta from last night and watch The Office while I eat. After cleaning up my dishes, I work on a spreadsheet for my principal where I keep track of how much engagement I'm seeing from my kids on their online learning."", ""11 a.m. — Zoom with my kids! Six of my 20 kids log on which is one more than last time so I call that a win! We catch up, play a game of Kahoot, and then they show me around their homes. I'm sad because my kids will be going to middle school next year so I won't even get to see them around school next year."", ""12 p.m. — Since I did my makeup, I decide to treat myself to an iced coffee (it's the little things). I use money I already have on my Starbucks app to pay. I enjoy every second of the five-minute drive."", ""12:30 p.m. — I FaceTime with my little sister (she's 11) because she needs some help with an essay she's writing. Once she's all set, I talk to my other little sister (she's 7) and read her a couple of books before letting her work in Epic. My sister R. and I are both teachers and are able to help the little ones with anything they need (and we got them all the supplies they could need when schools were closed). It makes me think about how we really can't hold all our students to the same expectations right now because not all kids are as fortunate as my sisters."", ""2:30 p.m. — After my FaceTime call with my sisters, I hard-boil some eggs for a snack and read my book. I keep my eye on the news and see that our governor has extended our stay-at-home order until May 31st. I support him 100% but I'm still bummed, especially since my commencement had to be postponed (I remind myself to be grateful I have my income during this time when so many do not)."", '6 p.m. — I make dinner just for myself today since R. and C. got takeout. I make handmade tortillas and scramble a few eggs with a tomato, a jalapeño, and an onion. Simple but a go-to meal for me.', ""8 p.m. — I finally get around to switching out my shoes. I manage to get all my boots into the suitcases for storage and I organize my sandals neatly into the closet. Once that's done, I hop in the shower."", '9:45 p.m. — Curse morning me that dumped all my laundry on my bed! I lie on the tiny sliver of my bed not covered in clothes and watch TikToks hoping my laundry will put itself away.', ""10:45 p.m. — My laundry did not put itself away. I drag myself up and put it all away in about 10 minutes (easy when it's all PJs and yoga pants). Do my normal bedtime routine and then promptly fall asleep."", 'Daily Total: $0', 'Day Three', '8:30 a.m. — Good morning! I wake up with no alarm and do my usual morning routine.', ""9:30 a.m. — I make myself a quick breakfast: a smoothie with banana, frozen strawberries, and oats, turkey sausage links, and two slices of toast. I have fresh bananas right now so I'm trying to enjoy them because I don't leave the house very often for groceries right now. Pre-quarantine I would go to the grocery store every day to buy produce as I needed it in an effort to not waste food so this has been tricky for me. After I eat, I wash my dishes, change into yoga pants, an oversized sweater and sneakers, make my bed, and put a new Bath & Body Works scent into my wall plug-in (white tea and sage is AMAZE)."", ""10:30 a.m. — Last week, my sister, brother, and I bought my mom a new grill for her Mother's Day gift. C. has the day off today so we're going to go pick it up at Home Depot. We're doing curbside pickup so we'll be socially distanced. It's a beautiful day out and I enjoy the ride."", '11:30 a.m. — We get home, unload the grill, and I hang out in my room for a few hours. I put on my favorite chill study music on Spotify (Chilled Cow) and finish my book. I\'m excited to add it to my classroom library, I think my kids will really enjoy it. I pick out my next book One Hundred Years of Solitude (this one is for me). I text back and forth with a photographer I booked a couple of weeks ago. My best friend and I are both graduating this spring and want to take pictures together but the extension of the stay-at-home order means we need to reschedule. I\'m glad I paid for those pictures up-front because I imagine this family is struggling right now. After this, I do my monthly debt tracker. I have been ""snowballing"" my credit card debt and have managed to pay off about $6,000 since January. This month my credit card debt goes down $1,400! I know getting this much credit card debt was irresponsible but I am working on it!', '2:30 p.m. — I make myself a late lunch — ham and cheese sandwich with tomatoes, a small bag of sun chips, two oatmeal raisin cookies, and an Arizona green tea. I watch another episode of Big Little Lies while I eat.', ""4:30 p.m. — One of my best friends, Q., is a barber and he cuts C.'s hair in the normal world. He comes over since barber shops won't be open for a few more weeks. I sit at the other end of the driveway and hang out with them."", '6:30 p.m. — Once Q. leaves, my sister and I hang out and play games. I have a few drinks while we play.', ""10:00 p.m. — We go get McDonald's (my sister drives and pays). Yay chicken nuggets."", '11:30 p.m. — Drunkenly change into PJs, do my normal bedtime routine, and fall asleep.', 'Daily Total: $0', 'Day Four', ""7:30 a.m. — Mornin'! I wake up, do my usual morning routine, and take a couple of Excedrin in case I get a headache from the drinks last night. I tidy up the kitchen, pick up the games we left on the table, and take out the trash then I get back in bed since it's still early."", ""10:30 a.m. — Thought I might fall back asleep but I never did so I get up now because I'm hungry. I consider going through a drive-through because I'm craving fries but I told myself I needed to be better about spending. I make oven fries with Cajun seasoning and a brunch burger topped with bacon and an egg. Turns out delicious!"", ""12 p.m. — I clean up the kitchen once I'm done eating then head back to my bed to watch another episode of Big Little Lies. I'm obsessed with Reese Witherspoon, she's so talented."", '5 p.m. — Woah. I ended up binge-watching the entire first season, I could not stop watching. I\'m starting to feel a little blegh from laying in bed all day so I get up and get in the shower. Today is Sunday so it\'s ""leg skincare day."" I\'m self-conscious about my “strawberry legs” so I have a routine to keep my legs soft and healthy-looking. I use an exfoliating glove to go over each leg twice with sea salt scrub. Once I\'m out of the shower, I pat my legs dry, apply witch hazel to help reduce the size of my pores, and then moisturize with Aveeno lotion. I do this twice a week and have seen a HUGE improvement in my legs since I started doing this.', '6 p.m. — My sister calls me for dinner, she made pasta. I have a bowl and C. fills us in on his workday while we eat.', ""7 p.m. — After dinner, my sister and I take the dogs on a walk around the neighborhood. It's beautiful out and the fresh air feels good. We stop by the mailbox because the essential oil diffuser I ordered was delivered yesterday."", ""7:45 p.m. — My sister is craving horchata so I offer to drive her to one of our favorite local places to get some since I need gas. We're both lucky to be getting paid our full salaries during this time so we try to support local businesses as much as possible. I fill up my tank and my sister buys us horchatas and she gets a carne asada burrito that C. can take for lunch tomorrow. $14.42"", ""9 p.m. — Once we get home, I read my book while I drink my horchata. I have a staff meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m. but I don't bother setting an alarm since I usually wake up by 8 or 9 on my own. I do my usual bedtime routine and I'm asleep by 10:30."", 'Daily Total: $14.42', 'Day Five', '10:12 a.m. — I overslept! The one Monday I don\'t set an alarm and I manage to sleep for almost 12 hours! By some miracle, my principal canceled our staff meeting so I don\'t have to log on late. I do my normal morning routine and check my work email. Today is the start of ""Teacher Appreciation Week"" and I see an email from our admin about all the things they have planned for us even with social distancing. I love the building I work in and feel so lucky!', '10:45 a.m. — I have leftover Cajun fries from yesterday so I decide to make a breakfast burrito. I dice some bacon and onions and sauté them. Once the bacon is crispy, I add the fries and then scramble some eggs into the mixture. It ends up being enough for three burritos so I freeze two of them for another time. I use my last banana to make a strawberry banana oat smoothie and watch Big Little Lies while I eat.', '12 p.m. — Once I finish eating and cleaning the kitchen, I straighten up my room. I really need new pillows and wish I could go browsing *sigh*.', ""1 p.m. — I sit at my desk to do some work. I post this weeks' online learning packets on Class Dojo and answer some messages from parents. I make and post a step by step video of how families can download the packets onto their devices since I've been getting that question a lot. I complete the packet so parents can have an answer key to refer to and post that as well. Then, I work on a teaching resource I'll need next year. It involves a lot of cutting, laminating, and organizing (my favorite types of tasks honestly) and is tedious. I didn't have time to do it when school was in session but now I'm dragging it out so I don't run out of things to keep me busy."", '2:30 p.m. — I put away my work things and head out for a drive. For day one of Teacher Appreciation Week, my principal has purchased drinks for us from a local coffee stand. I get a blended ""Aztec Mocha"" which has spiced chocolate and it is soooo good! I take the long way home with Fleetwood Mac blasting and the windows down so I can enjoy the fresh air.', ""3:30 p.m. — I sit outside for a change of scenery and just enjoy my drink, read my book, and look at apartment décor ideas on Pinterest. I've never had my own living space before so I'm really looking forward to my own apartment! I also call my best friend and we catch up. She's in her last quarter of nursing school and is doing clinicals at the hospital but thankfully she is not working with COVID-19 patients."", ""5:30 p.m. — My sister makes grilled cheese and tomato soup for dinner. There was an outbreak of COVID-19 at a local meat processing plant and the plant has been shut down. This morning there was a story in the news about how Costco will be limiting the amount of meat we can buy so we're going to try to make more meatless dinners to make our groceries last as long as possible. We hang out for a little while after dinner and I do the dishes since my sister cooked."", '7:30 p.m. — Shower time. After my shower, I send a couple of emails and send one of my kids the learning packets directly since he emailed me to ask for them. I remember that I miss my kids and get sad again.', '9 p.m. — I get in bed with my book after doing my bedtime routine and read until I fall asleep.', 'Daily Total: $0', 'Day Six', ""10:04 a.m. — I tossed and turned all night and didn't really fall asleep until 3 a.m., so I'm barely waking up. I have a 10 a.m. Zoom call so I call in four minutes late with my camera off."", ""11 a.m. — After my call, I head to the kitchen to make breakfast. I scramble a couple of eggs with chorizo and eat with jalapeños, queso fresco, and tortillas. While I eat, my sister and I start putting together a grocery list because it's time we brave Costco soon. When I'm done eating, I clean up and change into jeans and a t-shirt."", ""1 p.m. — I drive to my school because yesterday a parent reached out asking for school supplies (I go alone and will not interact with anyone while I'm in my classroom). I pack up all his stuff from his desk and book box into a bag and add in a couple of notebooks, computer paper, construction paper, pencils, crayons, scissors, glue, and a few other odds and ends that they might need for at-home learning. I label the bag and drop it off in the office. I message the parent to let her know the supplies are ready to be picked up."", ""2 p.m. — On my way out, I pick up a cherry limeade shaved ice from a truck parked outside our school. Our admin brought them out for day two of teacher appreciation week. This is also a local small business so I'm glad we can support them. I thank my vice principal who is greeting us (socially distanced, of course), and then head home."", ""2:30 p.m. — My best friend is graduating from nursing school next month so I browse online for a gift for her. I pick a nursing coloring book with funny quotes and a mug and wine glass set that says “before patients” on the mug and “after patients” on the wine glass. She's going to love it! $31.38"", ""3:30 p.m. — I put Underworld on the TV since it's newly-added to Netflix and I half-watch while I scroll through my phone. I've seen it a bunch of times and love it so I don't mind missing bits and pieces."", ""5:30 p.m. — For dinner, I make potato and chorizo sopes that we top with crema, sliced cabbage, and a fresh salsa I make out of my last tomato. I finished the last of the queso fresco this morning but that would also have been delicious on these. Can't justify going to the store for just one ingredient though."", ""7:30 p.m. — Once the kitchen is clean, I sit outside since the weather is beautiful. I'm trying to teach myself to do needle-point but it's not going very well."", ""9 p.m. — Regular bedtime routine and The Office in the background while I scroll through social media. I'm asleep by 11."", 'Daily Total: $31.38', 'Day Seven', '8:30 a.m. — I wake up happy and refreshed! I fell asleep right away last night and slept through the night. I get up, do my morning skincare, change into jeans, an oversized sweater, and my Birkenstocks, put my hair up in a ponytail, and fill up my Hydro Flask. I have plans to do some solo work in my classroom today and I am excited to have somewhere to go.', ""10:30 a.m. — I pick up an early lunch on my way to work at McDonald's. I'd love to support local always but sometimes you just need fries and a McChicken. I get extra buffalo sauce, a sweet tea, and two McDoubles that I'll give to my sister when I get back home. $12.48"", ""11 a.m. — When the governor closed our schools initially, it was only for six weeks so I didn't have my kids completely clean out their desks and book boxes. Now that they will not be returning, I get to do it all by myself. Yay. I get busy putting together packages for each kid so that they will have more at-home learning materials. I also add in granola bars, trail mix, goldfish, and juice pouches from the food pantry I keep in my classroom since that food was for them anyway and who knows if we'll have regular school in the fall."", ""11:45 a.m. — I've gotten through five desks when my sister calls. We had plans to go to Costco tomorrow but she just realized the dogs are low on food so she'd like to go now. I tell her I'll pick her up at 12:30."", ""12:30 p.m. — I pick up my sister and we head to C.'s job to pick up the Costco card. He tells us that the National Guard is giving out food nearby. We decide to check it out and get lucky because there's no line. We get milk, two 20-pound boxes of bacon, potatoes, onions, pasta, and some pantry items (they load everything in the car for us so the whole interaction is social distanced). I text my principal and arrange to drop the food off tomorrow at school. My school has a pantry going for our families who need help with food and I'm happy I'll be able to contribute to it."", ""1:45 p.m. — Costco was successful! We wore our masks and gloves and were in and out very quickly. The store is limiting the number of people allowed in at one time so it was not crowded at all. We get ground beef, chicken sausage, bananas, carrots, a tres leches cake, dishwasher pods, milk, heavy cream, orange juice, potatoes, bread, mayo, juice, soda, frozen strawberries, tortillas, eggs, shredded cheese, sour cream, condensed milk, honey, flour, scent pods for the laundry, and dog food. My sister pays and I transfer her for my share. (I realize for some of you mathematicians out there that this seems like a big chunk of the money I have leftover after bills and savings, but we only do a Costco haul once a month so I won't spend on groceries again until June). $97"", ""2:30 p.m. — Groceries are unloaded and sanitized with Clorox wipes and Lysol spray. I did all the shopping at Costco so my sister wouldn't have to touch anything (gotta keep my niece/nephew safe but she has to go with me since it's her membership) so now I'm taking a break while she puts everything away. Since it's her house, she organizes the fridge and pantry how she likes anyway."", '3 p.m. — I grab half a pint of strawberry cheesecake ice cream out of the freezer and log onto Zoom for a trivia game put on by our principal for day three of teacher appreciation week!', ""4 p.m. — Trivia is so fun! It's nice to chat with coworkers again. Once I'm done, I take my laptop out to the breakfast bar and hang out with my sister while she finishes organizing the snacks."", ""5 p.m. — My sister starts dinner. She is making honey pepper chicken and mac and cheese (like they make at Applebee's) and I help her make the honey sauce and crisp up the bacon."", '7 p.m. — After dinner, I help clean up the kitchen (I always like to go to bed with a clean kitchen, I hate waking up to dirty dishes in the sink). An OP on a recent money diary talked about Simcity: Skylines and made it sound so fun so I want to check it out. C. sees that it happens to be one of the free games of the month on his PS4 so he helps me get started.', ""8:30 p.m. — Ugh. An hour and a half later and I still can't figure out why my houses don't have power. I call it good and give C. the controller. I jump in the shower and do my leg care routine."", ""9:30 p.m. — Of course by the time I get out of the shower, C.'s city is booming! I make myself a cup of Sleepy Time tea with honey, do my bedtime routine, and read. I'm asleep by 11."", 'Daily Total: $109.48', 'COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic.

They live in a house they own in Memphis, and spent the week of their Money Diary celebrating A.'s 34th birthday."", ""In celebration of Money Diaries Month, we talked to A. and C. about what they thought of each other's Money Diaries, their spending philosophies, and what's next for them.

Were you surprised by anything?', ""A: Mostly when I read C.'s I was like, man, I should have been funnier in mine."", 'C: I wasn’t surprised by anything.

I have a note on my desktop for each paycheck — this much is going to savings and this much is getting paid to this thing on this date. I'm the one who is on top of that."", 'Do you feel like you have similar money and spending philosophies?', ""A: Yeah, what's your philosophy on spending money, C.?"", ""C: [laughs] My philosophy is that I only want to spend money on things that are more experience-based. Buying small material items like clothes and stuff isn't as important to me as a trip or something of that nature. That's what I'd prefer to spend money on it if I was going to do it. That and food. I spend money on food, which counts as an experience in my book."", 'Do you feel that way as well, A.?', ""A: I mean, yeah! I love spending money on experiences and food, and I also love spending money on stuff that I don't really need. But between the two of us, I'm definitely the one who spends money on more material goods. I try to balance it and be good about saving too, though."", 'C: When we got together, I think I was kind of nudged by her in the direction of being more responsible with my finances and focusing more on saving. Prior to that, I knew it was something I needed to do, but I had yet to make any concrete steps in that direction.', ""A: Before we got married, we bought a new car together, so we had saved together for that and then come up with a plan for how we were gonna pay it off really quickly. So I think that was our first real conversation that was like, we're gonna set a goal for this and then do the research and pay it off. And then after that, we bought a house."", 'You wrote in your Money Diary that the house is where most of your money goes each month. What have the biggest costs been?', ""C: When you're buying something that you're planning to fix up, it's kind of hard to plan. I had no idea what fixing a bathroom would cost. I mean, you make it work, but sometimes it feels like a bit of a Monopoly money situation. I had no idea at the beginning what doing a fixer upper would look like monetarily."", ""A: Yeah. We got a really good deal on a house that we loved, but it did need a lot of work, so we just kind of went room by room renovating it. We got a really good deal and were able to put down 20% and still have a little bit left over, so we did the kitchen. We budgeted for it and knew the total up front, but then as we went through other rooms, some of them, like our last bathroom, took two and a half years because we just did it piecemeal as we could afford to — one thing at a time. At this point I have no idea how much we've spent on all of it collectively, and I don't want to. I'm sure we could have done it more efficiently and more responsibly, but I don't know. Live and learn. It's almost done now, so..."", ""C: For the most part, there've been no unexpected costs. It's been pretty good so far."", 'A: We did need a new roof.', 'C: Yeah, we needed a new roof, and then our house got broken into once, so that was an unexpected cost.', 'What was stolen?', ""C: A TV and computers. But for me that wasn't as bad as the door and windows being broken and then having to get somebody in here to repair and replace them and redo part of the house. That was an unexpected cost and an annoyance."", 'A: Yeah so at that point we chose to get an alarm installed, which was a hassle and another cost.', 'Where did you guys move from and why did you choose to relocate to Memphis?', ""A: We moved to Memphis from a much larger city where the cost of living was certainly higher than it is in Memphis, but that didn't really play a role in us leaving. We'd moved to that city together for C. to attend law school, and we knew it was probably 50/50 that we'd stay or go after he graduated, depending on where he got job offers."", ""Then he got an excellent fellowship offer in Memphis that was a three-year commitment. We were really lucky, because I was working as a magazine editor for a company that allowed me to work remotely, so I didn't have to hunt for a new job at the same time. (I transitioned into nonprofit work later.)"", 'I was a little skeptical about Memphis, because I\'d spent a few years in the South already and was hadn\'t really connected with the culture the first time. But we were really communicative and positive about the opportunity and decided to give it our all. We were also really lucky that other ""expats"" from cities all over the country came in through that same fellowship program, so we had a built-in social support system of like-minded people to explore our new city with, and we made some lifelong friends. Memphis has been really good to us in a lot of ways.', ""Is there anything big that you're saving up for on the horizon?"", ""A: Actually, we're looking to relocate to the west coast, so now we're saving up for that. Hopefully we'll make some money on selling our house, but yeah, we've been trying to put some money away every month because it's expensive to move across the country!"", ""When we move, I kind of feel like we'll want to rent a place rather than buy for just a little bit to figure out exactly where we wanna be, but I also feel a little bit of pressure in that I don't want to have to pay those taxes (whatever those taxes are when you sell your house now!). And also, this is weird and seems small, but we have a pit bull, and it's really hard to find apartments that take a pit bull, so I feel like we may have to buy a new house really quickly!"", ""Do you guys have any feedback for each other after reading each other's Money Diary?"", 'A: Come on, C., bring it on!', ""C: I don't know, I mean, at this point we know one another's spending weaknesses. I think mine for her would be less stress spending. I think there's an uptick in purchases of personal consumer goods when she's under some pressure at work, and it's the same for me — I eat out more when I get under stress at work as well."", ""A: Yeah I think we both acknowledge that we need to find healthier ways to deal with our stress, and that's one of the reasons why we're trying to relocate. We want to have healthier lifestyles, and yeah, hopefully spend less on candles and food when we feel terrible about ourselves [laughs]."", ""This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

I don't wear makeup or put literally any effort into my appearance and instead use that time to sleep in as late as possible. Despite not being the sort of thin, attractive person who can get away with this, I DGAF. I would say this is 50% f*** the patriarchy and 50% I'm too depressed and too tired to care about my appearance. I've struggled with bouts of depression for most of my life.

We try to take a walk on our lunch most days to get some exercise and fresh air.', '5:30 p.m. — Get home and am excited to get a hilarious Christmas card in the mail from my best friend who lives across the country. I also find it funny that most of my oldest friends can\'t remember my husband\'s last name. I kept my last name when we got married and he goes by FirstName MiddleName on Facebook so 90% of the time when we get something in the mail from one of them for both of us, it\'s addressed to “MyFirstName MyLastName and HusbandFirstName HusbandMiddleName.” I eat a Luna protein bar on the couch while reading the news on my phone and make plans with a friend to go to her house for dinner.

While I'm sure it was written in a positive light partly so that Bennett can remain in her good graces as a member of her press corps, I'm left with much more respect for Melania than I had before. Especially in contrast to A Warning by the anonymous Trump White House official, which just confirmed that the West Wing is as much of a garbage fire as we all expect it to be, Free, Melania made me realize our country would be better off being run by the First Lady than by her husband.

I alternate between feeling despair about the state of our democracy and guilt about how Trump\'s demagoguery can be affecting me so much when I am in such a privileged position with thinking surely things can\'t really that bad, can they? Are we being gaslit or are we catastrophizing? Is this really the beginning (or maybe middle) of the end or just an errant blip in our history? The dichotomy of my thinking parallels the dichotomy of our country. It\'s easy for me to say I am on the right side of history and objective facts are in my favor but that is literally what the other side thinks as well.

I've been dealing with a lot of sciatica and hip pain lately.

I recognize an actor from Dark (German Netflix series) which reminds me of how much I can't wait until season three. If you like non-hokey time travel and intense drama, definitely check it out.

Not sure why an entire chapter graphically detailing a character hitting a deer and then taking it home and butchering it is really necessary, but whatever.

Fill up my water bottle (I've been trying to be a lot more consistent with drinking water the past week or two; if I'm not conscious about it I can go hours without drinking anything) and get ready to teach some sleepy high schoolers."", ""10 a.m. — After teaching is over, I move outside for some video calls and meetings. It's beautiful today and there's a little patio area outside my apartment unit that's sitting empty and calling my name. I work for about two hours before taking a break for lunch."", ""12 p.m. — I'm craving hot chicken so I place a curbside order from a local place. On my way to pick it up, I see a sign at the indoor/outdoor bar at the end of my street that they're selling cocktails to go. It's the middle of the workday so I don't stop, but I'll be back later. The sandwich is amazing, as expected, even though I can never quite finish it. I have some time until my next meeting so I work through some deliverables with Vanderpump Rules on in the background. I just started watching it last week. Yes, it's trash. Yes, I love it. $12.36"", ""2 p.m. — I stop writing follow-up emails, aka agonizing over the use of exclamation points vs. periods, because I don't want to come across as a bitch (feedback I've received on several occasions), but also am not excited that teachers I supervise haven't completed tasks that are due. Decide I need a break from work so I head back outside with Jia Tolentino's Trick Mirror to read for a bit (it's amazing, 10/10 would recommend). After about an hour I come inside, go to the bathroom, and realize I already have a sunburn. Whoops, forgot I was part vampire. Order some Neutrogena face and body sunscreen on Amazon so that I can go outside again before November. $24.17"", ""3 p.m. — End my workday with a virtual interview. There are few things more awkward than watching someone sample teach a lesson on Zoom with no students, but hiring must go on. I've probably done ten of these since we started quarantine. This one is particularly rough. After the longest hour of all time, I finally log off and call a couple of students to check-in. I try to reach out to a few of them each day; I work at a Title 1 school and a lot of our families are really struggling. About half of the work expenses each month go towards supplies for school, but the other half usually goes directly to some students to help with things like books for college or fees for the ACT. It's good to talk to the kids and hear their voices."", ""6 p.m. — Circle back to that tempting to-go cocktail option from down the street. I end up ordering two specialty cocktails and some chips and queso because I have no interest in cooking tonight. I put on a sweater to camouflage my goofy-looking sunburn and enjoy the walk to pick it up. I get home and immediately change into PJs, which for me is a mental signal that I'm “off” work for the day. I struggle with work-life balance normally and working from home on my computer full-time makes it even harder for me to turn it off. The food is good and the cocktails are even better. I haven't had liquor in probably two months so I'm very quickly tipsy. $30.24"", ""8 p.m. — Spend the rest of the night hanging around, watching TV, and texting back and forth with this guy, V., I matched with on a dating app at the very start of this craziness. It's weird — we've spoken literally every day for almost two months, but obviously haven't met in person yet. We'll probably get together in the next week or two in what feels like the highest-stakes first date of my life. I'm an expert single girl, which means that I've been on 500 bad first dates and 500 first dates that I thought were good, but apparently weren't? I promise I'm a completely average looking lady, but dating can definitely make you feel like an ogre. Anyway, it feels like I have a lot of emotional investment in this already, which makes me nervous. The combination of the liquor and the sunburn has me worn out, and I'm knocked out by 9."", 'Daily Total: $66.77', 'Day Two', ""4 a.m. — Wake up fully rested because I've been asleep for seven hours already. I lie in bed restlessly for over an hour before finally dozing back off until 8."", ""8 a.m. — Toss on a sweatshirt over leggings and a sports bra — not to go back to bed, but because I'm planning on working out between meetings this morning. Do a 30-minute yoga class through Obe fitness. I've had this for months but didn't start using it consistently until about three weeks into quarantine. I'm really loving it — 30 minutes is quick enough that I don't get bored and yoga is high-intensity enough that I still get a good sweat in."", ""10 a.m. — Sit in on a district meeting where they COMPLETELY change the grading and end-of-year policies for students, ending with them telling us we basically have five days to get everything finalized for the end of the year. I really, REALLY hate bureaucracy. Take a quick shower, change into shorts and a long sleeve tee (you know, because sunburn), and then spend a few hours reaching out to staff and families about the changes. They're stressed and frustrated, and I have to just take it even though this decision had literally nothing to do with me."", ""1 p.m. — I place a curbside order from my favorite local soap/beauty shop (it's like a local version of Lush). There are so many amazing local businesses here and I shop pretty local during normal times, so I'm trying really hard to support these same businesses in safe ways during the pandemic. Tennessee is actually officially open (yikes), but it's been great to see so many businesses being responsible and not opening even though they're technically allowed to. I want to make it a point to support these spots in particular. I grab some bath bombs, body butter, and a body scrub, all in my favorite scent, Black Raspberry Vanilla. $47.18"", ""1 p.m. — While I'm out, I stop at my go-to nail salon, probably one of the biggest gems in town. I bought a trio of cuticle oils ($18, paid for last week) and stop to pick them up. Am I going to become a woman who is diligent about cuticle care? Doubtful, but that's not really why I'm buying this anyway. Give into the no-cooking temptation and tell myself I deserve a treat for my rough afternoon and doing yoga this AM (does anyone else promise themselves gifts for working out? And then usually get the gift whether you work out or not?), so I grab an order of nachos and a big frozen margarita from a Mexican spot (so much curbside pickup this afternoon) before I head home. $30.73"", ""4 p.m. — Get home just in time to hop on a Zoom happy hour with some of my closest friends. We used to work together and hang out every Friday for three years. I seriously considered staying in a pretty toxic school environment just for them, but ultimately it was outweighed by how miserable I was at work and in the city I was living in. I'm so much happier now, but making adult friends is hard and I miss them terribly. The biggest silver lining of quarantine is getting to connect with them regularly. After my margarita, I lounge around watching more Vanderpump Rules and drinking some sparkling wine from Trader Joe's. I paint my nails and use my new cuticle oil, probably incorrectly. I get a really sweet message from a student telling me she loves my class and she aspires to read as much as I do. It makes me a bit emotional, which I blame on the alcohol and that I'm about to start my period, because feelings make me uncomfortable."", ""10 p.m. — Get ready for bed with my nighttime skincare routine of First Aid Beauty Cannabis Seed Oil, Murad Eye Cream, a Dr. Brandt Sleeping Mask, and some Sunday Riley UFO as a spot treatment — expensive, but magic, and lasts forever because I only use a drop or two. My skin has been freaking out a bit lately even though it's normally well-behaved, maybe because I'm approaching my period, so I briefly consider using a face mask, but I'm lazy, so I tell myself I'll do it tomorrow. I climb into bed and read, and then all of a sudden it's 1 a.m."", 'Daily Total: $77.91', 'Day Three', ""11 a.m. — Wake up. I'm a big proponent of sleeping in on weekends, and then staying in bed reading for another couple of hours. Saturdays were always my favorite days of the week: I'd go to a yoga class, grab a coffee, wander through the farmer's market and pick up some food for the week, and stop by one of the food trucks always parked there for lunch. In the afternoons I would relax, maybe see a movie, and then usually do something with friends or go on a date later (I don't do Friday social time, I'm always way too exhausted and usually in bed by 9). None of those things are happening now, so Saturdays make me a bit glum. I hang around my apartment and watch TV instead, finally taking a Vanderpump break to catch up on the latest episode of Mrs. America, which makes me feel semi-productive because it's smart television (low bar, I know)."", ""2:30 p.m. — I get hungry and decide to make a half pizza (not because I'm being thoughtful about portion size, but because I accidentally cracked the frozen crust in half). I'm a big pizza fan and try to avoid frozen pizza because I know they're awful for you. I add olive oil, TJ's pizza sauce, garlic, fresh mozzarella, and basil. This is not gourmet by any means, but it's also not DiGiornio, so I'm going to call it a win. Also, I may have stumbled into a genius hack. I don't like reheated pizza and half was plenty (though I obviously ate it all). Maybe I'll be cutting my crust in half from now on?"", ""9 p.m. — I spend the rest of the day alternating between reading and watching TV. At some point, I do the face mask I didn't get to last night; it's from First Aid Beauty, but I got it from TJ Maxx a while back. My bank account may not miss TJ Maxx, but I sure do. Eventually, I get hungry and make a quick pantry version of linguine. It's one of my go-to lazy meals, pretty similar in prep level to Kraft macaroni and cheese but feels more like an adult meal (but let me be clear, I do regularly eat Kraft). Read in bed until about midnight."", 'Daily Total: $0', 'Day Four', ""11 a.m. — Wake up, lounge around and read, call my mom to wish her a Happy Mother's Day (I sent presents for her and my sister-in-law awhile ago), and send a couple of texts to my friends that are mamas."", ""2 p.m. — Today is grocery run day, so I get dressed in a t-shirt, acid-wash jeans, and some Toms sneakers, do my normal makeup, and head out. It's a bit of a hike to Trader Joe's, but it's worth it. I realize on the way that I haven't eaten anything today so I stop and grab a sandwich from the drive-through ($8.01). Get to TJ's and stock up on some pantry samples, ingredients for a steak dinner, more stuff to make pizza, wine and seltzer, and can't resist grabbing one of the new Peony Blossom candles they have up by the register ($87.01). $95.02"", ""2 p.m. — I've been trying really hard not to go to more than one store, but I'm reaching critical levels on tissues (I have terrible allergies and I'm constantly congested from March-July) and toilet paper, so I pop into Target. I find tissues and allergy meds but strike out with toilet paper. While I'm there, I grab some Diet Coke and a couple of things for my apartment (Swiffer, dish soap, toothpaste, detergent, spice rack, a storage shelf, etc.). I'm normally gone from 6:30 in the morning until 7 or 8 at night during the school week, so adjusting to being in my apartment basically 24/7 has put me in full nesting mode. $113.01"", ""5:30 p.m. — Get home and see that I've been charged for next week's HelloFresh box. I recently restarted my subscription during quarantine. I LOVE the idea of meal kits; I live alone and hate wasting food, but also have a 3-meal max on leftovers before I have to drag myself to eat them. It's not cheap, but I feel like I'm eating well so it's worth it to me. I also spend way less on takeout this way. My biggest barrier is always how time-consuming the meals are to cook, but that's less of an issue now because I'm drowning in free time. $64.34"", ""7 p.m. — Decide to make one of the meals from my box. I choose brown sugar bourbon pork chops with apple pan sauce, scallion mashed potatoes, and roasted Brussels sprouts — way above my culinary skill level, but with the recipes and everything pre-portioned it's relatively idiot-proof. Prep all the ingredients and see that the recipe requires sugar, which I do not have. Look at the other two recipes in my box in desperation, and both also require sugar. Mentally kick myself for not checking before I went to not one, but TWO stores today, and then grab my keys and run to the gas station down the street. They have sugar, for what feels like a criminal $6.99, but desperate times. I also walk past toilet paper on my way to the register! It's 100% the toilet paper they use for their public bathroom, and I'm not sure they're even supposed to be selling it, but it's the first time I've seen toilet paper in a month so I grab two rolls anyway and a pack of Skittles. $13.16"", ""8:15 p.m. — After about an hour of cooking and using what feels like half of the pots and pans in my kitchen, food is finally done. It's ridiculously good, I practically lick my plate, and I put the second half away for tomorrow's dinner."", ""10 p.m. — I see that the leasing office sent me my lease renewal paperwork, so I read through it and sign. I love my little apartment and I hate moving (I've lived in six different places in the past nine years), so it's an easy yes. I most recently lived in the Northeast and am still kind of in awe that I can get such a beautiful apartment, brand new and downtown, for what I pay. My rent is only going up $30 a month, which is great because the cost of living raise I got for the upcoming year is a joke. I really wanted to ask for a more substantial raise; I'm very good at my job, and am 100% worth more than I get paid, but contracts went out in April in the middle of this pandemic, and with so much up in the air around state funding it didn't feel appropriate, so I didn't ask. I feel like a man maybe would have asked, but oh well. Go through my skincare routine, read and toss and turn until almost 2 a.m. At the risk of sounding like an actual infant, I'm not a very good sleeper."", 'Daily Total: $285.53', 'Day Five', ""8 a.m. — Crawl out of bed, feeling just really meh today. I didn't get enough sleep (under five hours according to my FitBit) and I'm painfully congested. I drink a bottle of water and suffer through an hour's worth of meetings, and then I don't have another meeting until 1. I have plenty to do, but instead I end up just crawling back into bed and dozing off and on until about 12:30."", ""1 p.m. — Have my weekly check-in with my boss; we don't have a ton to talk about but this is definitely going to be my only human contact for the day so it's good to have some social interaction. After we're done, I make myself another half pizza, and then I remember that today is the BoxyCharm Pop-Up, where they offer a selection of beauty products to subscribers at a steep discount. I log on and snag a Living Proof blowout serum and the Glamglow Good in Bed night cream. I put a pineapple serum by Glow Recipe in my cart but I don't move fast enough and it's gone before I get to the checkout screen. That would have been more of an impulse buy (I've tried and know I really like the other two), so I decide it's retail fate and check out, with an actual impulse buy of a soap infused sponge that I like to use for baths, but it's only $4 so I don't feel bad. It's all a $103 value, but my total is a third of that, so I feel pretty good about it. It's like virtual TJ Maxx! $37.69"", ""2:30 p.m. — In the plan for the day I laid out in my head last night, I was 100% going to do yoga today, but I'm just really not feeling it so instead I sit on the couch and alternate between working and reading for a while. I've spent a lot of my adult life beating myself up when I don't work out as planned, and I'm trying to get better about it, but the urge is still there."", ""6:30 p.m. — Decide to make a box of brownies I grabbed from Trader Joe's (the instructions call for a full stick of butter, which feels very Paula Deen, but I'm not a confident baker so I don't usually deviate from instructions), and then I heat up the rest of the dinner I made last night. It's still good, but definitely not as good as last night (hence why I don't love leftovers). Continue watching Vanderpump Rules."", ""8:30 p.m. — I still feel like crap, and then I remember that I just spent $70 on bath stuff a few days ago, and I haven't taken a bath in MONTHS (I've showered, just so we're clear). Get really excited and start heating some water on the stove. I make a bit of a production out of taking a bath — bath bomb, scrub and lotion, hair mask, shower oil, sparkling wine in a silicone glass (that I bought specifically to use with baths), music, the works. It's amazingly relaxing and is 100% the best decision I've made today."", ""11 p.m. — Climb into bed and blow out my hair. I purchased one of the Revlon one-step dryer brushes at the beginning of quarantine and at the risk of sounding dramatic, it has changed my hair life. I have relatively thin hair, but I have a lot of it. It's pretty long and I've never quite known what to do with it. It gets puffy when I blow-dry it, I don't know how to blow it out, and it's weirdly wavy-straight in a way that looks sloppy. All of which is to say, I can blow my hair out in about 15 minutes with this thing and it looks good for a few days without touchups. When I finish my hair, I read for a while. I'm on a bit of a nonfiction kick so now I'm working through Nicholas Kristof's Tightrope, and lights out around 1:30."", 'Daily Total: $37.69', 'Day Six', ""8:30 a.m. — Wake up and get ready for class. Toss on leggings, a sports bra, and a sweatshirt (I WILL work out today!). Try out one of the acai bowls I bought from Trader Joe's, and it is… not good. I take a few bites, but that's all I can manage. Luckily I only bought two to try them out. This is our last class before the AP exam tomorrow, and the attendance is low, which is frustrating. I'm not blaming the kids — they're seniors, a lot of them are working and doing a lot to help out their families, and virtual school sucks — but it's just not how I envisioned us ending the year. We go through the need-to-knows for the test, and then I spend some time just chatting with a few of the kids. I've known most of them since they were 10 or 11, so I'm really going to miss this crew."", ""10:30 a.m. — Do a 30-minute vinyasa yoga class on obé, and immediately feel so much better, endorphins are no joke. Take a really quick shower and get dressed in jeans and a long sleeve t-shirt and do some light makeup. Finish with my other hair miracle, the Bumble and Bumble Post Workout Dry Shampoo Mist. It does such an amazing job reviving my hair after a workout; it honestly makes me 1000% more likely to work out on days I wasn't planning to wash my hair. I decide to grab a coffee to refocus myself for the rest of the workday, so I drive to my neighborhood coffee shop and order an iced mocha and bagel sandwich with cheddar and bacon. I'm a big Dunkin' fan (it's the northerner in me), which is way cheaper, but I remind myself that Dunkin' is not struggling to survive in a global pandemic (and also this coffee is better). I call and order when I get there and they bring it out to my car; I keep a mask on anyway. I tip $5 because the baristas are lovely and I know business has been crawling. $15.01"", ""12 p.m. — Get back home with my “brunch” and settle in on the couch to work on transcript audits for the upcoming school year. It's a bit of a slog, but mindless enough that I can sit and watch equally mindless TV while I work."", ""3 p.m. — Quick break to check the mail, mostly just to move and breathe fresh air for a second. Get to my mailbox and see that my Rothy's are here! Once I moved into school leadership, I backed away from Toms as my go-to work shoe, and while Rothy's are definitely expensive, I think they're worth every penny. They're running a promotion now where teachers can get 50% off a pair, so last month I bought a pair (my fifth) of the points in Flame, a super bright red that makes me smile when I look at them. I wear them for the rest of the afternoon, half to break them in, and half because where the heck else am I going to wear them?"", ""7:30 p.m. — I look up from my laptop and it's nearing 8. Yikes. At least I got a lot done. I make another HelloFresh meal, tonight it's lemon butter chicken with couscous and mozzarella zucchini. Sometimes I look at the ingredient bag and scoff at what I'm positive is an incorrect portion — such as my single baby zucchini — but then I cook and plate it and it's always more than enough. This is why I need very clear instructions. Back to work."", ""11:30 p.m. — Finally call it quits. I know I'm about to be working nonstop until the end of the week to get all of the end of quarter stuff finalized, plus my kids' AP exam is tomorrow so I'm a bit nervous for them. I should have gone to bed earlier because I need to be up early and going all day, and I know it's going to take me a couple of hours to settle down, as always."", 'Daily Total: $15.01', 'Day Seven', ""8 a.m. — Wake up to attend the virtual staff meeting. It's over in 20 minutes and I decide to try to get some more sleep because the last time I looked at the clock was 3 a.m. I know I'm going to be working to get grades finalized all night so I figure better to get a bit of rest now. I'm largely unsuccessful, and mostly just lay in my bed with my eyes closed."", ""10:45 a.m. — Get back out of bed, do a quick 12-minute exercise class because that's all I have time for, and get dressed in a vintage wash long-sleeve tee and jeans. Do some light makeup, adding one of my favorite lip products, the Nars Velvet Lip Glide in Le Palace, one of the only reds I feel like I can wear without looking like a clown. I put on my Flame Rothy's and head out the door to go to school."", ""11:45 a.m. — Get to the drive-through at Dunkin' (no time for good coffee) and am somehow behind an actual pack of college-aged girls in what I'll loosely call exercise clothes, who are not in a car. I'm not that impressed, especially because you can walk into the store and order anyway, and if they were that concerned about social distancing they wouldn't be running with half their sorority. Also annoyed because I have places to be and they're each ordering individually. Get my iced mocha, exchanging meaningful glances with the Dunkin' employee. $3.98"", ""12:15 p.m. — Pull up at school for the AP English exam. People aren't going to like this, but here's the thing: students need laptops, reliable internet, and a quiet space to take an AP exam. I have students who simply don't have access to those three things, so we thought a lot about it as a school, and decided to offer an in-person exam for students who don't have other options. It's only four kids today and me today; we all wear masks, we sanitize the laptops and tables after they use them, and the kids are spread out across a giant cafeteria. I get this is not great, but please direct your @s toward CollegeBoard. I get a text a few minutes later from a student whose ride fell through; she tells me she'll just take the exam on her phone. This is an essay, y'all. I harass her until she gives me her address and I pick her up and drive back to school. In the 30 minutes before the test starts, I send five million encouraging texts to my students I can't see before they take the exam."", ""2 p.m. — We finish up, texts start pouring in from kids, and the general consensus seems to be “not that bad,” but we don't get scores back until July so we'll see. I stop at Chik-Fil-A on the way home because I realized at 1 I hadn't eaten at all today and also because are you even in the south if you don't regularly eat there? I get home and a package came from the Gap (I went a bit wild with online shopping in the early days of quarantine, but with all of the shipping delays, I'm just starting to get most of the stuff now). The package today is this beautiful white and yellow linen dress that I'm in love with, and have absolutely nowhere to wear it for the foreseeable future. Luckily it stays hot here until late October so I've got some time. It's sunny and in the 80s now so I apply some sunscreen (learned my lesson) and head outside to get some more work done. $8.38"", ""6:30 p.m. — I make it a good hour and a half before the heat drives me back inside, but I keep working until my Zoom date at 6:30 with two of my all-time best friends. We went to high school together and haven't all lived in the same place for almost 15 years, but we've stayed close. One of them, N., just had a baby in December who I get to “meet” for the first time. I'm so lucky to have these ladies in my life. When we're finishing up I get a text from another forever friend about partnering up for some virtual trivia tomorrow. I get a notification from Amazon that my melatonin gummies should be here tomorrow; I ordered these almost two weeks ago and they got lost, so no charge for the re-ship. I'm trying absolutely everything to help me get to sleep at night, and I'm hoping these make an impact because I'm getting a bit desperate."", 'Daily Total: $12.36', 'COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic.

Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?I think my parents would have supported me if college was not my path. Neither of them went to college or had any aspirations to do so. But, as it turns out, I've always been a huge nerd. I loved school and did very well at it. Towards the end of middle school, my mom started instilling in me that college was absolutely an option for me and that by doing well at school, it could be more affordable/attainable. My mother's salary was lower than the tuition for any school I applied to, and I had no significant savings, so it very well might have been impossible for me to afford it without major loans. Thankfully, I was accepted at a college that basically covers tuition and rent if your household income is below a threshold (through grants, not loans). I was incredibly lucky. I was the first in my family to go to college. I basically lived in a wealthy bubble for four years, which had some cognitive dissonance for me because both my parents went through hard job losses/financial struggles during that time. After college, I pursued a Master of Architecture, which is a professional degree needed to be an architect (similar to a JD or MD). I took out a loan for my first year of graduate school (~$58,000) in 2016 because my first-year financial assistance was minimal. This was a HUGE stressor for me. I had never handled that level of money, let alone debt. I felt guilty because I had been given the chance to go to an amazing university on a full-ride and instead of doing the sensible thing like finding a job after, I chose to obtain another degree that is notoriously expensive, especially compared to architecture starting salaries. For the other 2.5 years of my graduate education, I worked very hard to not go into any more debt. Tuition and rent were covered through a combination of merit fellowships, teaching assistantships, and taking an RA position in an undergrad dorm (free rent!). Once I became an RA and didn't have rent costs anymore, I basically dumped my assistantship stipends into the loan ($1,200-$1,500 a month). I also have some amazing cousins who took an interest in helping my mom and me financially from time to time. Overall, they probably contributed ~$15,000 towards paying down my loan over a few years. Once I graduated and had to pay rent again, I lowered my monthly student loan payments to $500-$700/month so I could also build my savings, which were basically non-existent."", 'Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?I grew up in a low-income, single-parent household. My dad was in my life socially but not financially, and he struggled at the end of his life with poverty and substance abuse. My mom made ends meet for the two of us. She was very open with me about her financial stress. Sometimes I wish she had been a little less open because I grew up with a lot of anxiety about money as a kid and very little agency to do anything about it. We got by, but I was constantly worried we were one crisis away from losing everything. She taught me the basics (saving is good, credit card debt is bad), but I have learned about things like student loans, investing, budgeting, etc on my own since then.', 'What was your first job and why did you get it?My true first job was babysitting, which I did all through middle and high school. I got it because my mother also babysat as a side gig to her main job and it was a logical way to introduce me to the idea of having a job/making and saving money. In high school, I also worked as a file clerk at an auto dealership and at Old Navy. Flip flop days were the worst.', ""Did you worry about money growing up?See aforementioned childhood money anxiety lol. Yes, definitely, and it wasn't until I was an adult and got serious about my own financial education that I felt like I had agency over my situation."", ""Do you worry about money now?Compared to the first 25 years of my life, I worry much less now. After being in school for seven years, $54,000 feels like I'm rolling in money. But I do think about it almost constantly — I budget, plan, check my accounts, and check my debt regularly. I worry that my mother doesn't have enough or that I should be making more to help support her when the time comes. Also, my partner is currently in law school and, after graduating, is going to be in an obscenely high debt/obscenely high income situation. So I also think a lot about what that will mean for us as we move in together, combine finances, etc."", ""At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?I basically stopped asking my mother for money unless I truly needed it after I went away to school at 17, but I was also in the massive financial safety net of my wealthy university. I'd say starting graduate school and taking on student loan debt felt like the first truly independent move for me, but I was also able to stay on my mother's health insurance until I turned 26. If I really fell on hard times, I could go home, but it would not be preferable and I would be a burden on my mom's finances."", 'Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.Yes, I have some wonderful cousins who took an interest in helping me and my mom financially through my schooling. In college, they would occasionally help me out with spending money or travel costs for summer programs. In graduate school, their contributions equaled about $15,000 of my loan. I also inherited $8,000 from my grandmother when she passed in 2009, some of which I used for braces. I received about $1,500 from my relatives when my father, who had no life insurance, passed in 2019.', 'Day One', ""7:15 a.m. — Wake up time! I live in a basement room that doesn't get a lot of light in the morning, so I use smart lights that fade on and simulate sunlight. I stumble to the bathroom to clean up for the day."", '7:30 a.m. — I turn on the rest of my lights and sit down at my desk to study. I\'m currently slogging my way through the six exams required to become a licensed architect. I passed three exams last fall and I\'m taking my fourth exam at the end of March. I typically study one or two hours a day and try to get that in before work when I can pull myself out of bed early enough. Before 9, I close my study binder and head upstairs to make oatmeal, cut up some strawberries, and boil water for tea. I say hello to my housemate and his cat (the queen of the household) before heading up to my ""office."" One of our other housemates has been at home with her family since the pandemic started, which means there\'s a spare room where I can set up my desktop computer so I\'m not a basement gremlin 24/7.', ""9 a.m. — I get on Teams for our morning team call. While my coworkers are chatting, I input the last of the info I needed for my tax returns and get those e-filed. I'm a little anal about filing my tax returns super early, but it feels good to get it out of the way. I file for free through OLT since my income falls below their threshold, which is great. I dive back into my multiple ongoing projects for work!"", ""10:30 a.m. — I remember that I never paid my online bill for my last therapy appointment — whoops. I log into the telehealth portal and take care of that. I also email my therapist and ask to push our next appointment out a week. I'm anticipating this week will be quite busy already and I'm feeling pretty solid right now. $70"", ""12 p.m. — I warm up some awesome sweet potato chili that I made last night (thanks NYT Cooking!!) and then listen in on a lunchtime talk on bike racks while eating and drafting an email to my boss. After lunch, I go out for a short run and shower. Why did I only wait an hour after eating chili to go for a run?? No idea, but I don't recommend it. After, I settle in for an afternoon of work and meetings."", ""6:20 p.m. — Around Christmas, I tried to order all of my Christmas gifts from non-Amazon sources, which was mostly fine, but it did lead to a package of books for my family being lost with USPS FOR TWO MONTHS and, like Odysseus weary and sea-worn returning home, it finally arrived yesterday!! After work, I package up belated presents for my mom and walk to FedEx to ship them. For the record, I am still all for supporting USPS, but the Philadelphia Distribution Center has given me trust issues and I want to make sure this package gets to my mom promptly. After I get home, I make some Annie's mac and cheese, study for a while longer, and make a Valentine's Day card for Sunday! I head to bed around 11:30. $15.42"", 'Daily Total: $85.42', 'Day Two', ""7 a.m. — Wake up, wash my face, and moisturize. I definitely have a disappointing skincare routine compared to a lot of people. I feel like I've never had the money to afford good quality skincare products. Now that I could possibly invest in them, it's still hard to make the mental leap and tell myself that it's an okay purchase to make. This is a frequent problem I have. I curl back up in bed and review some of my study flashcards. I also definitely fall asleep for 15 more minutes."", ""8:15 a.m. — It's snowy and cold today so I make some challah french toast for breakfast. While I eat, I add a new post to the joint Instagram I have with my boyfriend, C. We recently became avid birdwatchers and we made an account to share photos of some of the amazing birds we see! We really enjoy making the posts and adding facts about the birds, and hopefully, it's pleasurable for our ~100 followers (mostly friends and family)."", ""8:45 a.m. — Today I am comparing tile and flooring samples with a coworker for some apartments we're working on, which means it's a very rare day in which I actually have to go into the office! I put on real clothes and some makeup (possibly for the first time this year??). Normally on cold mornings, I'd take the bus in, but I make the 30-minute walking trek instead as per COVID."", ""12 p.m. — It's so weird being back in the office! After a morning of testing cabinet and flooring combinations with a coworker, we break for lunch. I warm up more chili and hide in one of the private phone call rooms where I can close the door and feel comfortable taking off my masks. Today was payday (yay!) and it's my non-rent paycheck, so I pay off my monthly credit card bill and send my half of our family phone plan to my mom. I also move a big chunk into my savings account and a much smaller chunk to my IRA."", ""6 p.m. — Classic day as a young architect: prepare a bunch of things for a meeting that your boss delays indefinitely and eventually just moves to tomorrow. Oh well! At least I got to hang out with another co-worker all day. On the walk home, I pick up my farm share box from my neighbor's porch. I get bi-monthly produce boxes from Philly Foodworks, which is an awesome organization that has been pulling its weight hard in the pandemic. I unpack my box of fruits, veggies, and tofu at home and warm up leftover mac and cheese for dinner. The Foodworks charge hits my account pretty soon after that. $40.29"", ""6:30 p.m. — I hop on a Zoom call with three of my friends from Boston. We have had a weekly call during the pandemic to catch up and watch trashy TV. Right now we're watching Are You the One, which is an absolute mess. These calls have been really wonderful for me; I moved to Philly shortly before the pandemic to be closer to my partner, but moving away from friends and then also being in quarantine has felt extra isolating. I'm lucky to have great roommates, coworkers, and my partner though! After, I make some herbal tea, study for another hour or so, and then play on the Switch for a while. C. bought me SoS Friends of Mineral Town as an early Valentine's Day present (I played so many Harvest Moon games growing up!) and it's been so fun to get into it again."", 'Daily Total: $40.29', 'Day Three', '7 a.m. — You know the morning drill by now. Wake up, wash up, early-morning studying. I make tea and chop up an apple for my oatmeal. While all the water boils, I wipe down the counters and table in the kitchen. My roommates are pretty considerate and clean, but with everyone working from home for a year, the kitchen is definitely in need of a deep clean. I make a mental note to discuss either doing that together or bringing in a cleaner (something we did monthly pre-COVID).', ""9 a.m. — I log on to my office's morning call. This morning is a lot of administrative talk. I spend the rest of the morning picking up edits on a drawing set we're working on for an apartment tower project. It's pretty independent work so I can listen to music and crank it out. I've been listening to a lot of Rising Appalachia this week, such talented women!!"", ""12:15 p.m. — I break for lunch, go for another run (this time BEFORE eating), take a shower, and warm up some chili. While on my run, Edible Arrangements delivers a box to my house! My mom sent it to C. and me for Valentine's Day and it has chocolate-covered strawberries and brownies (my favorites!!). So sweet of her. I put the box in the fridge and send her a thank you text. I feel bad that I didn't send her anything for Valentine's Day, but all my delayed Christmas presents are being delivered to her today so that kind of counts, right?"", ""7:30 p.m. — After a hectic day with another in-person meeting in the evening, it's time for the best part of my week!! C. picks me up outside the office, we grab takeout ramen ($16.06 for my half), and we head back to my apartment. C. and I live separately, but it was much easier to get between our apartments in the pre-COVID days of public transportation and warm biking weather. Now we tend to spend the week apart at our own places and concentrate our time together over the weekend. It's good for both of our productivity (C. is in law school and is swamped with work), but I miss him a lot throughout the week. We catch up over ramen and I give him a very USPS-delayed Christmas gift (Obama's new book!). After, I show him my farm on Harvest Moon, we fall asleep. $16.06"", 'Daily Total: $16.06', 'Day Four', '8:30 a.m. — Slooow wakeup with C. But we have big plans today!! We make some oatmeal and fried eggs and head out for the day.', ""10:30 a.m. — We like to celebrate Valentine's Day (and any holidays really) by trying out new fancy recipes together so we head to Whole Foods with a list of ingredients. I really hate the Whole Foods in my neighborhood and try to avoid it at all costs, especially in the pandemic. But when you need a bunch of specialty ingredients and want to pick up wine as well, it's the best nearby option. We double-mask up with KN95s and brave the Saturday morning chaos. One hour and many nerves later, we load up $80 of groceries and $50 of wine and beer into the car ($40 and $25 for my half). Highlights include some local beer-washed goat cheese, chocolate macarons, Beyond Meat burgers, and one large baguette. $65"", '12 p.m. — We arrive at an arboretum in North Philly for a really fun event! There\'s an amazing organization in Philadelphia called Philly Goat Project, which is a non-profit that offers its fourteen goats for animal therapy, sustainable grazing, and special needs/youth education. We bought tickets for their Valentine\'s Day Happy Hour fundraiser a couple of weeks ago ($60 total). We spend two hours hanging out with the goats (masked and outdoors), drinking beers that we brought, and learning about the organization from the volunteers who work there. C. buys a beanie and a raffle ticket, and we win some abstract ""goat art"" created by one of the goats. At the end, we get to take a couple of goats on a ""romantic goat walk"" around the arboretum. It\'s so fun and wholesome (even in the freezing cold) and we definitely plan on supporting them again in the future.', ""3:30 p.m. — Back home and thoroughly cold, we make tea and put together a picnic lunch from some of our Whole Foods haul (cheese, crackers, strawberries, etc) and eat it sitting in bed and watching Taskmaster. If you haven't seen Taskmaster, it's all on YouTube and it's hysterical. Also another book that I had been waiting on from USPS arrived!! This is the first time since Thanksgiving that I am no longer waiting on packages from the USPS. Amazing."", ""7 p.m. — We had a late lunch and aren't quite ready for dinner yet, so we watch the first 90 minutes of the seventh Harry Potter movie ($4.23). We were both big HP fans growing up and realized we'd never watched it together, so we've been watching one or two movies a weekend for a month now. It's a huge disappointment that J.K. Rowling turned out to be a super problematic person, but the movies really hold up and bring back all sorts of memories of reading the books and going to midnight releases as a kid. $4.23"", ""8:30 p.m. — We take a break to make dinner. Tonight we're trying a recipe for edamame ravioli out of a cookbook that my roommate gave me for my birthday. It's all Philly-area chefs and recipes from their restaurants, which is super cool. The edamame ravioli is from a restaurant called Buddakan, which is super popular. It takes a while to make (lots of filling wonton wrappers), but in the end, it's SO GOOD. We eat it in the kitchen, offer some ravioli to my roommate, and finish off the bottle of wine that we opened for the ravioli sauce. Afterward, we finish the HP movie and head to bed around 12:30."", 'Daily Total: $69.23', 'Day Five', ""9 a.m. — I wake up, wash up, and then promptly get back in bed with C. and wish him a happy Valentine's Day. We cuddle, scroll Instagram, and show each other memes and pictures of birds for a while. This is actually the first weekend in a long time that we aren't birdwatching, which typically means waking up much earlier."", '10:30 a.m. — We make some eggs and challah toast. C. has some law school work to do today, so we sit at the kitchen table and I study, catch up on emails, and drink tea while he works. I also give my mom a call to thank her for the Edible Arrangement and tell her about the goats.', '1:30 p.m. — We take a break from work and go for a walk. We grab chai lattes from my favorite nearby coffee shop ($4.25) and make a big loop around the neighborhood. We stop at the outdoor window for the hardware/home goods store. We head home, warm up some leftover ravioli for lunch, and continue with working/studying/laundry/etc. $4.25', ""5 p.m. — We finish with productivity for the day and play a game of Wingspan, our favorite board game. It actually fueled our interest in birdwatching in the first place. We've played over 100 times in the pandemic and C. keeps a spreadsheet of our scores. Yes, we are that nerdy. Tonight C. wins, but just barely!! We also exchange Valentine's Day gifts, which are mostly bird-themed this year."", ""6 p.m. — We start our evening cooking adventures. Our (eclectic) menu consists of French onion soup, DanDan noodles (with a recipe from DanDan in Philly!), and lava cake (a V-Day tradition). It takes us about three hours to make it all, but cooking together is one of our favorite activities and it's a ton of fun. The food all comes out pretty great and we have enough leftovers to share with my roommate and last us for lunch all week."", ""9:30 p.m. — We make some tea and watch the last Harry Potter movie!

Definitely no chance of studying this morning. C. decides to stay for the day and work next to my desk, which is always really nice.', '9 a.m. — I spend the morning typing up notes from all our meetings last week and coming up with a gameplan with my coworker on how to tackle our tasks this week. The pace on our project is really picking up, but it felt like we got some crucial decisions over with last week which is encouraging.', ""12 p.m. — After a flurry of morning coordination emails, I take a lunch break and go for a run. It's mid-thirties today, which is a pleasant change after running in ~20-degree weather last week. After, I warm up the very last of my sweet potato chili (which, by this point, I am very sick of), chat with my roommate a bit, and get back to my desk. I start feeling pretty nauseous around 3...might have let that chili live for too long."", ""6 p.m. — I log off for the day and C. and I warm up leftover DanDan noodles and steam some bok choy. We watch another episode of Taskmaster with dinner. After, I prepare for an 8 p.m. college admissions interview call. For the past few years, I've volunteered as an alumna to interview prospective applicants who are applying to my undergrad alma mater. I really enjoy it — the kids are always so talented, enthusiastic, and excited about what they may do in college. I don't think my reviews of the students affect the admissions process very much, but I try to advocate for particularly inspiring students that I interview. The student I speak with tonight is really sweet. I can't imagine trying to plan for your future in the middle of a pandemic, so I'm very impressed by their attitude."", '8:30 p.m. — After I finish the interview, I play some more Nintendo Switch while C. finishes up his emails for the day. Around 10, we warm up hot chocolate and the brownies my mom sent and read a chapter of The Subtle Knife out loud together before going to bed around 11.', 'Daily Total: $0', 'Day Seven', ""7:15 a.m. — I manage to pull myself out of bed even though I'd rather just continue cuddling with C. I wash up and spend an hour studying building codes at my desk while C. keeps sleeping. It's actually quite nice and cozy. After I finish a chapter, I crawl back in bed for a few more minutes."", ""8:45 a.m. — We get up for real this time and throw together some oatmeal and tea. I head upstairs for my morning call and dive into work again. I'm trying to figure out what medicine cabinet we need to use and where it needs to be placed in all of our apartment units. Sometimes architecture is about designing inspiring buildings, sometimes it's about the mounting height of a medicine cabinet."", ""12 p.m. — I break for lunch and warm up the leftover French onion soup for C. and me. We eat and then pack up his stuff and his half of all the food we made this weekend. We say goodbye and he heads back to his place for the week. I'll likely see him again on Friday. It was extra nice having him here until Tuesday and I know I'll be a little lonely the rest of the afternoon. I hop on a client meeting call to take meeting minutes. The rest of the afternoon is spent editing those and coordinating a couple of tasks with my coworkers. I take a break at some point to look up the price of flights in August and dream about when we can go on faraway vacations again."", ""6:30 p.m. — I go out for a walk around the neighborhood and have a long phone call with my best friend. It's way colder than I expected, so I cut my walk short and fold laundry until our call finishes up. My aunt gave me AirPods for Christmas and I've never had good Bluetooth headphones before, so I still get a lot of novelty out of completing tasks while on long phone calls. It's the simple things sometimes."", '8 p.m. — I warm up the last of my DanDan noodles and hard boil a couple of eggs to go on top. The rest of the night is spent studying a little longer, writing up a review of the student I interviewed yesterday, and chatting with my roommate in the kitchen while finishing off some Halo Top ice cream. I finish the night with more Harvest Moon and then fall asleep.', 'Daily Total: $0', ""Money Diaries are meant to reflect an individual's experience and do not necessarily reflect Refinery29's point of view.

Luckily, my fiancé, N., and I have essential jobs we can do from home. I shower, get dressed, and do my morning skincare routine: Aveeno foaming cleanser, vitamin C serum, and Olay moisturizer with SPF. Then, I make some tea before a busy morning of emails, calls with staff, and completing reports."", ""11:45 a.m. — The morning flew by so I break for lunch — peanut butter on low carb bread. I rarely eat breakfast, so I've only had tea and water so far.

When we get back, I make chicken fettuccine alfredo for dinner.', ""6 p.m. — After dinner, we go through our bills and finances. N. and I just combined finances last week and it's the first time we've had to navigate the new system. We've combined everything except our separate fun money accounts. We use an app, Honeydue, to monitor our budget, bills, account balances, debts, and savings goals. I also track all our individual bill payments and our plan for each check in a separate Excel spreadsheet. After decades of managing my own money, it's an adjustment."", ""9:30 p.m. — I start my nighttime skincare routine: micellar water, CeraVe cleanser, Thayer's toner, Neutrogena hydro boost moisturizer, then a Curology formula meant to help with fine lines and pigmentation. I've only had Curology for about a month. I don't notice a huge difference yet, but I'll give it a few more months before deciding if it's worth it. We stay up talking and finally go to sleep around 10:30."", 'Daily Total: $0', 'Day Two', ""7:20 a.m. — Quarantine has really messed up my sleep habits. I've been sleeping about nine hours each night and waking up barely before work. I check my phone and read the news for ten minutes before I grab my work laptop and cell phone to start my day in bed. I check in with my staff and complete our required morning report."", ""9 a.m. — I have a FaceTime meeting with one of my staff members to discuss her workload and check in. N. and I live in a one-bedroom apartment, so we're limited on space. When we have calls and meetings, one of us works in the bedroom while the other is in the living room. It feels so weird to spend big chunks of my day in bed."", '12 p.m. — Our preferred grocery store has been booked solid for grocery pickup slots. Two weeks ago, I was lucky to snag a pickup for today. We live less than five minutes away, so I run over during my lunch break. I pick up our order of chicken breasts, rice, pasta, cereal, Diet Coke, sparkling water, tortillas, crackers, bread, strawberries, onions, peppers, broccoli, asparagus, butter, snap peas, cheese, salmon, almond milk, and water. $130.26', ""1 p.m. — After putting away all the groceries and answering work emails, I have a quick lunch of cheese and crackers. While eating, I get a call from my uncle with an update about my grandmother. She has COPD and was just diagnosed with lung cancer. She's in the hospital, and with everything going on, I'm constantly worried about her. Today, she's being transferred to a rehabilitation center. We'd been told to let her rest in the hospital, but I'll call her once she's settled at the rehab center."", ""4:30 p.m. — While I appreciate not having to deal with the stress of a commute, I really miss the separation between my work life and my home life. Usually, we take our dog on a walk to create some separation; however, in classic Wisconsin fashion, there's a snow/hail mix that came out of nowhere. So I start prepping dinner instead — roasted potatoes and leftover ham from Easter."", '6 p.m. — After dinner, we spend the evening playing with our dog and watching the season finale of Ozark (!!). Then, N. watches his shows while I spontaneously decide to bake peanut butter cookies. What is it about quarantine that inspires non-stop baking?', '9:45 p.m. — I do my nighttime skincare routine and brush my teeth. I fall asleep while N. watches YouTube videos.', 'Daily Total: $130.26', 'Day Three', ""7:30 a.m. — N. and I wake up and discuss the bizarre dreams we've been having in quarantine. After giving N. all the details of my nighttime adventures with Ariana Grande (so bizarre), he takes care of the dog while I hop in the shower. I definitely do not shower every day, and some days, I don't bother to change out of my pajamas. But today, I shower, do my skincare routine, and get dressed in normal clothes. I haven't worn any makeup or styled my hair since we started working from home four weeks ago and today is no exception. I figure the break is good for my skin and hair."", ""11:15 a.m. — I've had a busy morning approving staff work and answering emails. I've also been catching up on some mindless tasks that are usually at the bottom of my to-do list. It's tedious but I'm so excited to finally cross them off my list. I take a small break to make some tea and grab a cookie."", ""12 p.m. — I break for lunch but just end up stress eating more cookies while M. and I discuss our wedding. We were supposed to go to NYC next month to elope and then have a party here the following month. We canceled the party and we're discussing when to reschedule our elopement. We already paid deposits to all our vendors (photographer, officiant, hair and makeup artists) in NYC, so we're still set on going there. Plus, we're in love with the idea of having photos of us all dressed up with the skyline behind us. As we discuss, we decide to pay our photographer the remainder of our bill. She's a gig worker in the epicenter of this pandemic, so the money might be more helpful now rather than later. $418.80"", ""4:30 p.m. — No snow today, so we take our post-work walk with the pup. It's freezing out so we're only gone for about 25 minutes. After we get back, N. gets dinner ready. I usually make all our meals, but tonight, he makes Key West chicken and rice."", ""5:30 p.m. — While N. is finishing dinner, I get a call from our wedding photographer. After touching base earlier, she wants to chat about our plans. We determine that waiting until August is a safer bet. After dinner, I work on emailing our other vendors to see if they're available for the new date."", ""9:30 p.m. — N. and I spend the night vegging. He plays videogames and I read Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino. Before bed, I do my skincare routine and brush my teeth. Then N. and I snuggle and talk about how selfish it feels to mourn our wedding when others are struggling with their jobs, health, and finances. Nevertheless, we acknowledge how disappointed we are that we can't get married next month. On the bright side, at least we still like each other after a month of quarantine."", 'Daily Total: $418.80', 'Day Four', ""7:30 a.m. — I wake up and check my work phone. There was a bit of a crisis so I spend the morning frantically sending emails and completing reports. Consequently, it's one of those days where I don't bother changing out of my pajamas."", ""11:45 a.m. — We break for lunch and I have some plain Greek yogurt with strawberries. I read a New Yorker article about Sally Rooney in preparation for a virtual book club meeting I have tonight. We read Rooney's most recent novel, Normal People, just in time to watch the Hulu adaptation."", ""1:30 p.m. — The governor just announced our shelter in place order is extended until after Memorial Day. I'm not surprised and I understand it's necessary. Nonetheless, I am exhausted thinking about another five weeks of this."", ""4:40 p.m. — We head out for our daily walk. While we're out, N. says he's craving pizza. He's also feeling particularly cooped up today, so he places a curbside pickup order at a local pizza place. Since it's not groceries, this will come out of our fun money. $22"", ""7 p.m. — Book club time! This is one of my favorite quarantine activities and I really hope it continues post-lockdown. We decide our next two books are Trick Mirror (which I'm already reading) and In The Dream House by Carmen Machado. I find In The Dream House on Amazon and download it for my Kindle. I have a credit from buying my last book so I get a great deal. $2.90"", '10:30 p.m. — We stay up a bit later than usual reading and playing video games. Then skincare, teeth brushing, sleep.', 'Daily Total: $24.90', 'Day Five', ""7:20 a.m. — I have a weekly Zoom meeting with our management team every Friday so I need to look presentable. I shower, do my skincare, comb my hair, and put on clothes that aren't pajamas. I then spend too long choosing a fun background for our pride-themed meeting."", ""11:45 a.m. — After our meeting, I break for lunch. Once again, I have yogurt with strawberries while I watch The Office. I'm a creature of habit."", '1 p.m. — Our favorite local donut shop is doing a curbside pickup and N. is so excited. We run out to get two fritters, one apple and one cherry. I initially think $5 for a fritter is a bit steep but it turns out these are massive. Literally the size of my head! I can only eat a quarter of mine. $12', ""4:30 p.m. — After work, I'm cranky and tired (probably from the sugar crash), so I take a quick nap. Every Friday, we choose a different local restaurant to support. So while I'm napping, N. calls in a pickup order at a local Thai restaurant. $39.76"", '6 p.m. — After picking up our food, we catch up on Brooklyn Nine-Nine while we eat. N. and I then spend the rest of the night reading endless online articles and reviews of sneakers and skincare products, respectively. Are there real adults who have perfected their skincare? I ponder this until I do my semi-satisfactory skincare routine and pass out around 10.', 'Daily Total: $51.76', 'Day Six', '8:45 a.m. — People who keep their same sleep schedule on weekends are magic. I am incapable. Instead, I do my usual Saturday morning routine: sleeping in then laying in bed for several more hours reading and snuggling the dog. We snack on leftover fritters for breakfast.', ""12 p.m. — N. and I head to N.'s mom's house. We bring her some food and check-in to see if she needs any other groceries or anything. She's 64 and a cancer survivor, so we're making sure she's not going out into the world for anything. We wear masks and stay outside, but honestly, I still feel uncomfortable about the visits. N. and I argue a bit about the risk."", ""3 p.m. — On our way home, N. stops for gas ($10). I run inside to grab a few snacks since it'll be our only chance for junk food until I go grocery shopping in a week or two. I get soda, Doritos, beef jerky, and licorice ($19.66). $29.66"", ""4 p.m. — I call my grandma. She tells me she's exhausted from doing physical therapy. We only chat a few minutes before I tell her to go take a nap."", ""5 p.m. — We heat up leftover chicken and rice for dinner. N. convinces me to watch Olympus Has Fallen on Netflix. The plot is ridiculous, but it's entertaining enough. We get sucked into watching the two sequels. One's on Netflix but we have to rent the other. After our quarantine binge, we pass out around 11:30. $4.21"", 'Daily Total: $33.87', 'Day Seven', ""8:30 a.m. — Lazy Sundays are my favorite. There's no urgency to anything we do. I get up and make some tea while N. runs the Roomba. I make the same DJ Roomba joke every time. I imagine that's what N. will cite as the reason for divorcing me someday (jk, hopefully)."", ""1:30 p.m. — We spend all morning just lounging around, reading, snacking, watching The Office, and napping. It's a balmy 50 degrees out, so after a bit, we decide to go outside and enjoy it. We head to a local dog park that's big enough to easily avoid other humans. I stuff my pockets with sanitizer, wipes, and dog bags."", ""2:45 p.m. — We take my car to the dog park and on the way home, I stop to get gas for the first time in over a month. It's crazy cheap ($9.62)! At the gas station, N. runs in and buys a pack of IPAs from a local microbrewery ($12). We're low on beer, and as true Wisconsinites, this is an essential purchase. $21.62"", ""3:30 p.m. — I decide I should be slightly more productive. I start the laundry and change our sheets. N. is in charge of cleaning and dog duties while I handle the laundry, cooking, and dishes. We rarely argue about chores and we each think the other one does more. It's an ideal setup."", ""5:30 p.m. — Since it's still nice, we decide to grill. Our apartment has several grills so we head out with burgers, asparagus, and disinfecting wipes."", ""9:30 p.m. — We spend the evening drinking and watching The Last Dance, an ESPN special on Michael Jordan. N. is obsessed with basketball and still heartbroken over March Madness, so this is the best he can get during quarantine. Afterward, it's my nighttime routine and bed."", 'Daily Total: $21.62', ""Money Diaries are meant to reflect individual women's experiences and do not necessarily reflect Refinery29's point of view.

Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?Yes, there was and though I excelled in high school, I really didn't want to go to college. I was a photographer and ended up going to a very good art school but dropped out after two years. I eventually went to culinary school and my parents paid for both. I do NOT recommend culinary school for so many reasons!"", ""Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?My mom was a saver and my dad was not. He was several years behind on his taxes until my mom pulled him out of it. Mostly, I learned about saving and not accruing credit card debt from my mom. Most of my mother's wealth now is from property my dad bought in the 1960s and 1970s, but I don't believe I will ever be able to own property in Los Angeles."", 'What was your first job and why did you get it?My first job was at a local coffee shop as a cashier and barista. I got it in high school for spending money and continued it into college.', ""Did you worry about money growing up?I didn't really worry about money per se, but I knew that I couldn't have the Guess jeans that all my friends had in sixth grade. We did not take fancy vacations or anything like that. My parents made much more money when I got a little older and my mom would definitely indulge us. I didn't get an allowance; as a teenager, my mom just basically gave me what I asked for (obviously within reason)."", ""Do you worry about money now?Yes, all the time. At the start of the pandemic, my $60,000 salary was taken away and we were all given $15/hour. I was on partial unemployment until the first reopening last June. When we reopened, I was offered $20/hour, which I negotiated to $25/hour at the height of a very busy summer. I used to work 10-12 hours a day as a salaried employee, but now I only work six to eight hours a day and bring in roughly $45,000 a year. It's been a big hit for me because I have some big bills, such as my very expensive health insurance (which most restaurant people I know don't have). Thankfully, my rent is not bad."", ""At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?Up until age 25, I was living rent-free at home. I moved out with my then-boyfriend and that's when I became fiscally independent. I do have a decent amount in savings and retirement I could tap if needed, and my boyfriend definitely came through last year chipping in more for the monthly expenses (his job was unaffected by the pandemic and he makes more money than I do). I could also rely on my mom for help if needed."", 'Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.Several years ago my mom gifted me $10,000 after the sale of a building and I put it in a mutual fund. I have occasionally taken out some money to travel, then not touched it to let it grow again.', 'Day One', '8 a.m. — I arrive at work, put some ice cream base on the stove to start cooking, then sit down with a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios and a double espresso. The perks of being the boss, I can have breakfast as soon as I get to work. Today is Sunday and we have brunch service, so it will be a busy day. Our general manager gets in after my breakfast and since she is one of my best friends, we spend 15 minutes reviewing the gossip of the last few days. Restaurants are full of gossip, all the time, and she knows all of it (as a good GM should). I take a low dose of Xanax (prescribed to me) because busy Sundays make my heart race.', '4 p.m. — At the end of my Sunday brunch shift, I always sit down with our GM for an amaro and more gossip; we call it amaro clock. The gossip today is about trying to replace our chef de cuisine AND sous chef at the same time, no good at all.', ""5:30 p.m. — Since I've already spent a long day cooking other people's food, I hate to come home and cook on Sunday nights. I stop at a Jersey Mike's and get sandwiches ($20.20 with tip). I get home and my boyfriend, S., and I unwind with bourbons (with a splash of my favorite amaro in mine, restaurant people love bitter aperitifs) and music and talk about our days. We watch Schitt's Creek with dinner (after he rejects the headlines on 60 Minutes, we are old) and I am sad we are almost done with the series. $20.20"", '8:30 p.m. — Get into bed because I have to open the restaurant tomorrow and have to wake up at 4:15 a.m. I am currently rewatching Dexter and it takes me about two episodes to actually fall asleep. S. stays up grading papers and playing video games in the living room. He teaches from home and literally never leaves the house, I have no idea how he can stand it.', 'Daily Total: $20.20', 'Day Two', ""4:15 a.m. — 4:15 is deeply horrible. No matter how much I do it, there is nothing natural about getting up in the middle of the night. I get up, read the nightly email from the restaurant, and scroll Instagram for a few minutes before turning on the shower. My cat and I have a ritual where I lay back down in bed for the five minutes it takes the shower to heat up and she sits on my chest for pets until she gets tired of it and tries to bite me. At 5 a.m., I'm off!"", ""7:30 a.m. — Once the pastry case in the cafe is fully stocked, I can finally relax with some Cheerios and espresso. We are out of strawberries for my cereal but I remember there is leftover farmer's market strawberry compote from a dessert special and spoon the whole runny, jammy mess into my bowl. I applaud myself for my cheffyness. Also there is now bonus strawberry milk left at the bottom of the bowl."", ""12 p.m. — Lunch! You would think working in a restaurant would give you a lot of lunch options, but you just end up tired of all the food, even the food hacks where you frankenstein the various components into new dishes. Our GM and I keep a variety of frozen foods on hand that are quick to make, so today I settle on a few chicken tenders (easy access to a fryer is magical), some bagel chips, and my house-made ranch for dipping. Always ranch. After lunch, I make an ice cream base and some little frozen mousses for dinner service. Even though I hate hate hate opening, it's better than closing and gets me home early in the day."", '2:30 p.m. — I get home just as S. is finishing a Zoom class. We chat about our days and he laughs this kind of wheezy laugh and stops and asks me if I remember an old cartoon dog with a laugh like that. YES, I DO AND HIS NAME IS MUTTLEY. He is an old Hanna-Barbera cartoon and the sidekick to Dick Dastardly. S. makes me spend the next half hour watching Muttley on YouTube and trying to perfect his Muttley laugh. He hurts himself a little. I spend the rest of the afternoon reading both newspapers I subscribe to, Eater LA and Buzzfeed, then taking a well-deserved nap with the cat.', ""5:30 p.m. — Time to start thinking about dinner. I pour us some bourbon and pull up the Smitten Kitchen recipe for baked pasta with sausage and broccoli raab, it's S.'s favorite. After the pasta, S. eats a cookie I brought home from work and I eat...a piece of parmesan. Here is the worst thing about me: I'm a pastry chef and I don't really like sweets. But give me a piece of good cheese and a few olives after dinner and I am in hog heaven.

I have to open the restaurant three days a week now and it honestly never gets easier.', '10:30 a.m. — After a morning spent making muffin batter, ice cream, and sponge cake, I lean under the station to get something and somehow knock over a sanitizer bucket right into my shoe. My pants and socks are soaking wet and I briefly consider just giving up and going home.', ""11:30 a.m. — Our chef and owner comes in to do some R&D and it's nice to see them. They set up to work on the table next to me so I get to have little tastes. Our chef is very famous and isn't here very often. (Celebrity chefs DO NOT cook in their restaurants.) I'm glad I didn't leave even though I am still squishing in my shoes. I bake off a few of my new cookies and they love it, and I am very happy."", '2:30 p.m. — I get home and S. is still talking about Muttley. I decide I am going to buy him a stuffed Muttley, figuring I can find a vintage one, but I go online and discover that because he was in a strange movie called Scoob! last year, Amazon sells stuffed Muttleys! I snap one up and keep it a secret from S. $13.83', ""5:30 p.m. — Bourbon and amaro and dinner time. I've been super into french onion soup lately (Smitten Kitchen recipe again), and when I make it there's always leftovers that I freeze so I barely have to do any prep tonight. I pair it with a quick salad. I top the toast on the soup with about twice as much gruyere as is advisable, and the cheese pull is phenomenal. S. eats the ice cream I brought home from work and I have a stick of Juicy Fruit gum, another favorite dessert. We eat, watch Jeopardy, go for a quick walk, watch some Schitt's Creek, then I am in bed early so I can wake from the dead one more time tomorrow."", 'Daily Total: $13.83', 'Day Four', '4:15 a.m. — Ugh.', '8:30 a.m. — One of our cooks urgently calls me into the other room, so I hurry over. I find three people standing around a tub of something that looks like jam, jiggles like jam, smells like jam, and is labeled ""jam."" They want to know if it is jam. I consider going home.', ""1 p.m. — Lunch with our GM. The days we work together are ALL about lunch. Today, it is a frozen Amy's cheese pizza, which I top with good olive oil, sliced pepperoncini, and pineapple (come at me). We obviously dip our crusts in ranch. We toast to our own lunch brilliance and gossip some more on the patio."", '2:30 p.m. — Get home and flop on the couch to work on my cookbook. A friend is setting up a meeting for me with a culinary book packager. I spend some time working on the main introduction and on recipe introductions. I compile my own photos and daydream about a book full of big glossy photographs.', ""5:30 p.m. — S. has a Zoom meeting with his family while I get started on dinner. Before you accuse him of not pulling his weight, he is NOT allowed to cook. When I met him, he was eating quesadillas filled with granola. I make yet another Smitten Kitchen recipe (I owe her everything) of tomato sausage risotto (if you're looking up the recipe, I add a small box of basil to it and it makes a world of difference). I have to balance what I make during the week because S. needs leftovers for lunch since he works from home, but I don't want to end up with too many leftovers because I will NOT eat them (leftovers are gross except for pizza and Thanksgiving). This will make a few days of leftovers and S. eats them happily.

I get myself all set up to run the machine, then have breakfast of scrambled egg, hash browns, and espresso. I get started spinning, and while the ice cream spins, I do the dishes. One of the worst consequences of the pandemic is that we no longer have a daytime dishwasher and it is TERRIBLE. With four to six people working in the kitchen, you have to stay on top of the dishes or you are sunk. We all hate it."", '12 p.m.— Lunch with the GM is the good snappy hot dogs from the butcher shop that I throw in the fryer to cook.', '1 p.m. — One of my favorite specialty vendors who is also a good friend comes in under the pretense of trying some new vanillas. We gossip for two hours on the patio and taste vanilla for about ten minutes (did I tell you restaurants are built on gossip?). She works for an independent purveyor who is obviously struggling right now and I try to source as many things as possible from her.', '4:30 p.m. — I get home, grateful it is my Friday, and MUTTLEY HAS ARRIVED. I tell S. to close his eyes and put out his hands and I hand him Muttley. He is over the moon and shows off his Muttley laugh. Then the three of us watch some cartoons.', ""7 p.m. — Tonight is pizza night and we order a salad and a large pizza ($43.81, S. pays). I get veggies on my half and S. complains that it's too slimy when he eats it leftover. But he eats it anyway. I bring home S. a piece of carrot cake and I have...another slice of pizza for dessert? I would like to tell you that when I don't have to get up the next day, I go to bed late, but once you're used to going to bed early, you can't stop. I take a sleeping pill so I don't accidentally wake up early, and it is bliss."", 'Daily Total: $0', 'Day Six', ""9 a.m. — SLEEP IN! I wake up, make coffee, read emails and scroll Instagram, then start working on my grocery shopping list. It's a task I love. I meal plan for the whole week and only go shopping once a week."", '10:30 a.m. — Off to the grocery store. I get the basics here, then shop elsewhere for specialty items. Among other things, I get Four Roses bourbon, canned salmon as a treat for the cat, Svedka vodka and tomato juice for bloody marys, hickory chips for the grill (hooked on hickory), cheddar for burgers, and the prep for chilaquiles, pad see ew, cassoulet, and baked potato soup ($110.36, split with S.). $55.18', ""11:30 a.m. — Head over to the Original Farmer's Market at Third and Fairfax. I love using the vendors there and shopping local for the fancy stuff and quality meat. From the butcher I get sausages for the cassoulet, flank steak for the pad see ew, and burgers to grill tonight ($24.50, split with S.). I get a baguette ($4.50, split), and go wild in the cheese shop for our weekly Friday lunch. I get a soft cheese (Brillat Savarin), a hard cheese (Beaufort), a blue (Fourme d'Ambert), proscuitto, and Castelvetrano olives ($38.70, split). $33.85"", '12 p.m. — After shopping, I hit the seafood restaurant there for my favorite weekly treat: oysters! I get six oysters on the half shell and slowly, quietly slurp them down. It is heavenly. I would get a dozen but $50 on something that is barely a snack is hard to justify. $24.90', ""12:30 p.m. — Get home, put away groceries, start a load of laundry ($2.25) and then finally settle in for a bloody mary with ALLLL the garnishes and some reading. I am reading Dr. Carl Hart's Drug Use for Grown-Ups and it is a clear-headed and very different approach; the drug policies in this country are offensive. Lunch is a groaning board of the baguette, meat and cheeses, and tomatoes and peppers. After this weekly lunch, we have a family agreement to pass out in our respective spots (me, couch, S., bed). I put on The Conjuring 2 and quickly fall asleep. I take horror movie naps, and yes, the screaming wakes me up. $2.25"", ""7 p.m. — It is grilling time! S. sets up our little Weber grill behind the apartment and I make homemade onion rings. We top our burgers with barbecue sauce and an onion ring and it is *chef's kiss*. I always have to remember to buy beer for S. because he apparently cannot run the grill without a beer?

I have coffee, look at emails and Instagram, and text a friend about coming over later for bloody marys. I got COVID at work at the end of January (I started having symptoms the morning after a negative test, so word to the wise about using negative tests as a free pass to see people maskless) so I figure I have the immunity to sit on the front lawn having drinks from six feet away with a friend (S. will stay inside; he somehow managed to not catch COVID from me). I get a second cup of coffee and manage to book an appointment for the vaccine! Our area just opened up for food service workers to get it and I am very excited. Even if it has a microchip in it.', ""12 p.m. — Every Saturday we get sandwiches from my friend's cafe. This week I get the best cheesesteak in the city and S. gets a chicken laffa wrap. We watch an old episode of The Simpsons while we eat. I pine for a nap but my friend is on his way. $35"", ""1:30 p.m. — Bloody marys on the front lawn with my best friend! It's nice to feel slightly normal."", ""5:30 p.m. — Pour a bourbon and start the prep for chilaquiles. I make the sauce and the tortilla chips from scratch.

We both had gym memberships before we were married but we've canceled them to cut back on spending, so my husband runs back home from the store for exercise. $100.22"", '6:30 p.m. — Every Friday night, we eat Chinese food and rent a movie. We had friends over Friday, so our tradition got pushed to Sunday. My favorite place is closed on Sundays but trying something new was a nice change. $22.54', ""9 p.m. — We're planning a trip to London next year and have a budget discussion. My mom and I are big into earning credit card reward points for travel, so my husband and I weigh the pros and cons of signing up for two new cards for their free hotel stay sign-on bonuses.

Upon entering, we're told that the tasting is two and a half standard drinks each, so I sit out for this one, since I'm driving. I still have a couple tiny sips of a few that I haven't tried before: Spiced Negroni gin, Modern Australian gin, Chardonnay barrel gin, and Sherry cask gin...YUM."", ""1 p.m. — We're feeling a bit hungry (and the others are getting a little tipsy), so we decide to head to lunch at Innocent Bystander. It's super busy today, and it seems like all of Melbourne had the same idea, so we have to wait a couple of hours for a table. We do a complimentary tasting of their range while we wait. Eventually, our table is ready and we order truffle and pecorino fries, broccoli salad, and three pizzas to share. The others each get a glass of wine but I get a lemon mineral water. We split the bill with our friends, and I pay for my boyfriend and myself. $51.50"", ""3 p.m. — After lunch we head to another vineyard (Yering Station) and try more wines. Our friends are going through a Chardonnay phase, so they try those while my boyfriend focuses on reds and I try a bit of a range. We buy a bottle of red and a dessert wine (so delicious) to take home (boyfriend pays), and our friends find a Chardonnay that they like. We head to Yarra Valley Dairy to sit down and have a cheese platter, but unfortunately there are no tables left, so instead we do a complimentary tasting, and I buy two different types of marinated goat's feta (one in saffron, garlic, and herbs, and one in chili oil) and a cow's cheese spread with dill to put on bagels for breakfast. They also have a really cute reusable bag, so I buy one to put the cheese in for the trip home. $30.30"", ""6 p.m. — Finally get home after dropping our friends off! My mum and I make a big batch of veggie-heavy fried rice with bacon and egg, and I make extra to take to my friend's place when I visit her tomorrow. She had twins a few months ago and also has a two-year-old, so I try to always come with some meals for them, as she definitely has her hands full! After dinner, we veg out in front of the TV for a couple of hours before heading to bed."", 'Daily Total: $81.80', 'Day Four', '6 a.m. — Early start today, as I have an operating shift on the other side of the city. My boyfriend makes us breakfast of flat whites and sliced tomatoes on toast while I get ready (love him!). In return, I drop him at work on my way.', '11 a.m. — My operating shift finishes early today, so the primary surgeon and I decide to go for a walk together, as neither of us is hungry for lunch yet. I stop by my house to pick up my dog so she can come for a walk with us (two birds, one stone). I pay for parking next to the park, and we go for a nice walk in the sun. My surgical work is incredibly light this week because of the public holiday. $1.01', ""12 p.m. — Text the boyfriend to see if he's free for lunch, as the park is a block away from his work. We head to a place we love that makes delicious hot chicken sandwiches (Southern USA-style) and serves natural wines. Trying to be alcohol-free today, so I get a soft drink instead to go with lunch. Boyfriend pays."", ""3 p.m. — Head over to visit my friend and her babies, bringing the fried rice and a birthday present for her two-year-old (a soft toy unicorn from Cuddle + Kind bought a few weeks ago). It's nice to see her, and we hang out and have a cup of tea for an hour or so while I get lots of baby cuddles. They are super cute, and her two-year-old loves her toy. My friend mentions that she has been feeling a bit left out of friend excursions lately, and I ask her to come with me to the ballet in six weeks, since I have an extra ticket. I have a season pass to the Australian Ballet (bought in December of last year), which is incredibly expensive, but I absolutely love going."", '5 p.m. — Make plans with a couple of my friends to see I Feel Pretty tomorrow night after work, and I buy my ticket online. No one can be bothered cooking tonight, so we decide to order in Indian food from this amazing place that has really authentic, super spicy food. We order from Uber Eats (and Mum pays): samosas, pav bhaji, chicken tikka masala, aloo baingan, butter chicken, garlic naan bread, and rice. The Uber Eats guy tells us this is his fave place when he drops the food off! $16.61', 'Daily Total: $17.62', 'Day Five', ""9 a.m. — I'm meeting a friend and her daughter for brekkie this morning, so I drop the boyfriend off at work on the way and park my car outside the café using the PayStay app to pay. I get cilbir eggs, green juice, and coffee and we catch up on each other's lives while my dog and my friend's daughter play. It's my friend's turn to pay for lunch, so she gets the bill. I'll get it next time. Unfortunately, I forget to cancel my parking when I leave, so I end up paying for the full two hours instead of the one! $6.06"", ""12 p.m. — I head into the city to go to the gym. My gym is located in my favorite shopping center, and I decide to have a look at the shops before heading up. I have a dinner tomorrow night that I'm a bit nervous about — it's a dinner with my boss's friends (some who I have met and worked with before), but everyone there will be five-to-10 years older than me and professionally a few steps above me, so I feel a little bit out of place. I try on a few dresses at Zimmermann, but none of them are quite right for the occasion. Then I find an amazing mohair coat at Scanlan Theodore, which I fall in love with and purchase ($492.70). After the gym (cardio and a meditation class), I go to another store and purchase a pink knit dress, plus a merino knit jumper for my boyfriend because there's a promotion where I get $75.80 off if I spend at least $227. $666.40"", '2 p.m. — Eat leftovers for lunch at home and settle back into work for a few hours.', '5 p.m. — A couple of my friends come over after work. I make us all negronis (my favorite cocktail, so I always have all the ingredients on hand!) and then we head to the cinema. We get a large popcorn to share and a bottle of water each. My friend pays, and we split it three ways. After the film, we decide to get burgers and potato gems. We walk back to my place afterwards, as one of my friends parked her car there earlier. Shower and bed! $34.11', 'Daily Total: $706.57', 'Day Six', ""9 a.m. — Boyfriend and I both wake up craving baked goods and coffee, so we stop by a bakery near us and pick up savory cheese and bacon rolls (he pays), which we eat at home with home-made flat whites. We spend the morning hanging out and watching a couple of episodes of Chef's Table on Netflix."", ""2 p.m. — Boyfriend heads out to spend the afternoon/night with his mates, and I heat up leftovers at home for lunch. I mope around a little in the afternoon, and my mum and I watch a couple of episodes of Imposters. I start getting ready for my boss's dinner — earlier than I usually would, because I'm nervous! I decide to wear the new Stila eyeshadow gel that I bought a couple of weeks ago, because GLITTER!"", ""7:30 p.m. — Get to the dinner and actually have a pretty good time. Because there are so many of us, the restaurant dictates that we have either five or seven courses of the chef's choice. We go for the five courses. I also have two cocktails. We split the bill evenly ($79.60 each) and I leave an extra little tip ($7.59). Tipping isn't necessary in Australia, as everyone earns a fair wage, but I used to work in hospitality and I know how difficult it is! We head to a speakeasy-style bar after dinner, and I have two more cocktails. I contribute $37.90 to the bill for my drinks at the end. $125.09"", ""2 a.m. — It's late when I leave and I don't want to have to wait up to 20 minutes for the tram, so I take an Uber. So much better to be home within five minutes at this hour of the night! Wake up my boyfriend when I climb into bed and get him to warm me up (sorry not sorry!). $7.51"", 'Daily Total: $132.60', 'Day Seven', ""8 a.m. — Nothing gets you out of bed faster than the sound of your dog about to vomit on your sheets. We managed to get her out in time but not the best start to the morning! Luckily, my mum went to the market in the morning and there are fresh bagels for breakfast! We have them with the cheese spread that I bought at the dairy store in the Yarra Valley, and they're delicious."", ""10 a.m. — When I was getting ready last night, I used up the last of my favorite liquid eyeliner pen, so I replace it via the online store and also order a new eyeshadow brush. (I'm new to using eyeshadow so I'm slowly building up my brush collection.) $62.92"", ""11 a.m. — My boyfriend is obsessed with boardgames, and I agree to play some with him today. We play Terraforming Mars with his new expansion board, followed by Great Western Trail. I win both games (whoop whoop), which doesn't often happen! For dinner, we make slow-cooked beef, red wine ragu, and fresh fettuccini. I pack in a lot of veggies and let the slow cooker do it's thing.

Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?There was definitely an expectation for me to attend higher education. Growing up in an Asian household, my parents constantly pressured me to attend/apply to prestigious colleges. It was a meter of success for them. These conversations began in elementary school. They were disappointed when I went to an in-state college instead, although it was viewed as the next best option. I received my bachelor's degree from an in-state college. My tuition was funded by my mother and my room and board were funded by my father. I received a small scholarship for my academic achievements and funded my day-to-day spending with on-campus jobs (barista, teaching assistant) along with summer internships."", 'Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?Growing up, the first thing that was instilled in me was the importance of saving. My grandparents and parents both emphasized this. Later on, my mother educated me about investing to the best of her ability. My father educated me about spending on the right things (things that improve quality of life).', 'What was your first job and why did you get it?My first job was as a KUMON instructor in high school. I nabbed the job for some extra spending money.', 'Did you worry about money growing up?I did not worry about money growing up. My parents both earn a comfortable salary and have saved well their entire lives. They both started their own businesses and are invested in financial instruments. I am conscious that I was an expensive child and that my parents spared no expense (piano, ballet, violin, ice skating, clarinet, additional supplementary online courses). In return, I worked my hardest at every single class I went to. I think even when I was younger, though, we were quite conscious about how we spent money. It was never careless and we would save in ways that we could.', 'Do you worry about money now?I do worry about money now. I view money and savings as a measure of freedom and am trying to save aggressively for retirement, ideally early. At the same time though, I believe in spending money on experiences and things that make memories. All of that being said, I am actively trying to grow my income as fast as possible while simultaneously cutting costs where it makes sense. I am also trying to develop/brainstorm passive income streams. Investing in equity is one method that makes sense given the amount of time I need to spend on my current job (80 hours minimum/week).', 'At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?I became financially responsible for myself at 22, although I think my mother did a good job of progressively developing my financial responsibility. In high school, I was responsible for my own gas. In college, I was responsible for budgeting my day-to-day spending and started covering my own phone bill. I believe that either my mother or father would be willing to step in financially if needed.', 'Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.In college, I was given an allowance of $100/month in addition to what I already had. Around the holidays (Christmas, New Year, Lunar New Year, and my birthday), my grandparents always tended to slip me $1,000-$2,000. My family also gave me around $6,000 collectively for my move to NYC (an excessive sum but I think they felt guilty for not physically helping me move since it was during COVID).', 'Day One', ""9 a.m. — Good morning! I wake up, scroll through my email notifications, and then head to the bathroom to start my skincare routine. I got my first facial three days ago, and the kindest facialist told me to focus more on moisturization. Routine is Great Barrier Relief serum from KraveBeauty, a dab of Vaseline Advanced Repair moisturizer, and La Roche Posay SPF 50 sunscreen. Afterward, I pour myself a cup of cold brew along with half a cup of oat milk and take a moment to write a sentence on what I'm grateful for today."", ""9:30 a.m. — Login to WFH life and scroll through my emails. Nothing pressing at the moment, although I flag a few emails from last night that I'll address and work on later in the day. I've found lately that waiting to reply to emails can sometimes be the best solution (issues often resolve themselves). I see a notification about my tax forms and take a moment to consolidate and send everything to one email. Will handle these next month when I get home and can use my mom's TurboTax account."", ""10 a.m. — Roommate heads over with her boyfriend's new puppy! Take some time to pet him and chat about our recent experiences with COVID. I tested positive at the beginning of January and had relatively mild symptoms (only remaining issue is that my sense of smell is not back at 100%). She had a recent COVID scare and had to quarantine."", ""10:30 a.m. — Work starts popping off in earnest. I answer a few emails, mess up sending out an email invite, and send out materials for a call in an hour. I frequently feel micromanaged at my job and am actively job searching. After handling, I sit down and consume some social media, online window shop, read some articles, book my next facial in a month, and look at some tennis clubs in Manhattan. I'm looking to join one in the near future since I think it's important for my mental health to actively pursue hobbies on the weekends."", ""11:30 a.m. — Jump on a call where we walk through IPO materials with a high-touch client. We've been sending materials every other day, most of these created by moi, resulting in the most annoying dynamic. I take a deep breath and remind myself to be grateful for my paycheck, the experience, and the opportunity to learn."", ""12 p.m. — Make some lunch. Samyang Buldak Light ramen, three eggs, and some frozen veggies. First time trying these instant noodles. The verdict is that they are definitely good, but I prefer the Chicken Carbo noodles that are creamier. Head out for a 30-minute walk. It's snowing pretty heavily and although I love snow, I quickly abandon the walk and decide I will go for a quick yoga session. On my way back up to my apartment, I notice a cute lamp in the furniture disposal area of my building. Have an internal debate about whether or not to grab, given that my room is tiny. Decide to grab it and test it out."", ""1 p.m. — My dad calls me to tell me he's made a Costco account and to buy vitamins from it. I order the vitamins and pet the puppy goodbye. Quick 20-minute yoga session during which multiple emails from the VP flood in. I try to resist the urge to check during yoga, but get too anxious and check through the emails before resuming my yoga session. Back to work."", ""2 p.m. — Natural lull in the day, haven't gotten any new emails in twenty minutes or so. Feeling a bit tired (worked until 2 a.m. last night), so I masturbate then take a nap. Back up checking and responding to emails. Itching to go out for a run but the weather forecast isn't great...decide to just go tomorrow. Eat a couple of gyoza and an apple. Make a reservation for a 5 p.m. gym session in my building, fingers crossed I can make it."", ""5 p.m. — Get changed and head downstairs for a quick full-body weights session. Keep an eye on email, luckily nothing urgent comes through. Back upstairs for a quick body shower, and a layer of Innisfree green tea serum on my face. Refill my water bottle and make a cup of green tea. Have a moment of internal panic as it's Day 42 of my menstrual cycle, before trying to reassure myself that it's likely because last week was pretty stressful in terms of work. Then freak out again by reminding myself that I've been randomly spotting the past two to three weeks. Make a mental note to get a pregnancy test tomorrow."", ""6 p.m. — Dinner! Spicy salmon leaf salad from Dig Inn (bought yesterday) with two clementines. Right as I'm about to eat, several things happen at once. The associate emails my team asking to catch up, a friend asks whether we can FaceTime because she's debating breaking up with her boyfriend, and my boyfriend texts me (first time today I might add) that something at work happened today that might affect our relationship. One thing at a time. I eat dinner, then start working again. FaceTime my friend. Text the boyfriend back. Keep an eye on email."", ""8 p.m. — Work on some materials, then lose motivation. No one's emailed me chasing for them anyways. Do my nighttime skincare routine (Matcha hemp cleanser, Great Barrier Relief serum, Laneige lip mask), brush my teeth, and then snuggle into bed all while keeping an eye on my emails."", ""10 p.m. — VP emails and I say a quick prayer to myself it won't result in more work, then open her email. Thankfully, the associate blocks and tackles the request. I get peckish and slice up an apple to eat before returning to bed."", '11 p.m. — Field a few emails from my phone.

Say a quick prayer that this means my period is coming and then start looking into reloading my Commuter Card (allows me to put in pre-tax money and save!). The website is pretty old and outdated. $255"", ""10:30 a.m. — Receive an email telling me my credit score's decreased. Cue confusion. I've paid off everything on time, so conclude that this is because I opened a new credit card this past month (Amazon credit card for 5% back on Amazon and Whole Foods). Start reading through the morning news, Morning Brew, Term Sheet, and occasionally Money Stuff by Matt Levine (really enjoy this one but it tends to be longer)."", ""11 a.m. — Meeting for IPO. Juggle client request emails during the meeting. When I flip back to the meeting, I realize that it's developed into a shitshow free-for-all. Cue shrug. Not really my problem. Address a LinkedIn headhunter request as well."", ""12 p.m. — I am HUNGRY!! A weights session will definitely do that to me. Same lunch as yesterday (ramen, eggs, veggies). Reply to emails and head out for a quick walk outdoors. Back to work afterward. Call my mom and chat about boy life and whether I should take on a new business opportunity managing a family member's portfolio. A new deal comes down the pipeline at work. Kind of exciting, but at the same time, means more work. Another analyst takes point on running the model while I start pulling together preliminary research materials to prep the whole team."", '3:30 p.m. — Lace up my sneakers and go out for a 30-minute interval run. Check emails during the run. Shower and shave, work a bit, then clean and vacuum my room. Make a bowl of oatmeal with vanilla greek yogurt, almond butter, and monk fruit sweetener, eat it, then back to work. Handle some emails from headhunters as well.', ""6 p.m. — Slice up an apple because I'm peckish. Eat while on hold with tech support. My boyfriend finally replies to my text from this morning. I consider myself a pretty low-maintenance girlfriend but am considering bringing up the topic of replying more often. I get that it's a workday, but maybe he could text me briefly during lunch? Don't want to come off as crazy, but it really would be nice to get a message every three or four hours. Despite these thoughts, his text really does make me smile."", ""7 p.m. — I'm hungry. Air fry some gyoza and veggies and decide to not wait for the boyfriend for dinner as he said he wouldn't be here until 8, which would mean waiting two more hours to eat. Buy shaving cream from Amazon. My boyfriend comes over afterward bringing baklava and a tiramisu tart! It's our one month. We chat and go pick up his take-out. He eats, I eat the treats and another apple. He is the sweetest. We cuddle and have sex.

I almost cry before shoving my noise-canceling foam earbuds back in (they fell out while I slept) and rolling over. My boyfriend's alarm goes off and he leaves for work. I don't need to be up this early but I can't really fall asleep anymore. I'm never really able to sleep past the first alarm. I begrudgingly get up and check emails as there's a lot of noise in the apartment now. The cleaning lady came over (she is the sweetest!). Roommate texts me her ATM card isn't working, so I front the cash, leave it on the counter, and Venmo charge my roommates. This is the first time we've had a cleaner! I haven't counted it into the monthly utilities yet, because I'm not sure this is going to end up being a regular occurrence. $43.34"", ""9 a.m. — Skincare, coffee, baklava, and one line of gratitude. Read through a few R29 articles. Login to work laptop. VP for a different team emails and I see that no one on that team is logged in yet, so I run the preliminary calculations and debate sending them through since I don't usually cover these. Decide against it and a few moments later the second-year analyst covers it, cha-ching! Also have a moment of panic because I really need to coffee poop, but the bathroom is covered in Clorox and not ready for use yet. Go poop anyways."", ""10 a.m. — Read through a few morning newsletters and see that the stock market dipped yesterday. Debate whether it is too late to buy into the dip, but then check markets and decide that it's not. Briefly read through the investment thesis of an ETF I'm interested in (I'm not allowed to buy single stocks because of my job), check its top 10 holdings, and decide that I like what I see, then deploy a bit of capital. See a Bloomberg article about a possible psychedelics ETF and make a mental note to research and possibly invest in the future. Log in to a three-hour-long meeting. While it's going, I answer headhunter emails and fill out job search forms they've sent through."", ""11:30 a.m. — Juggle two meetings. One from my phone and one from my laptop. Our VP gives a pretty good rundown of the Gamestop situation. I'm always impressed by how well-spoken and concise he can be. He's definitely one of the leaders I take notes on. Personable, friendly, communicative, balances stakeholders well, sharp with numbers, business model savvy, and a great dad to boot. Almost seems like a superhero, but then I remind myself that these are the facets of him that he's chosen to show me (over Zoom lol)."", ""12 p.m. — I am so exhausted, but this is really per the norm every time I get my period.

Eggs, avocado, naan, sriracha, Everything but the Bagel. A go-to and so delicious! I usually put kimchi on this too, but today I am out. I don't feel good (way tired) so I have another energy drink. Writing this down makes me realize this is probably not the healthiest approach...but they can't be that bad for me, right? Go for a quick 30-minute walk in the sunshine."", '2 p.m. — Start work again and immediately feel overwhelmed. An associate just dumped a ton of work on me and I feel like crying before I remind myself to take things one step at a time.', ""2:30 p.m. — Take a break. Answer some texts. Feel like crying but try not to. Mom texts with a stock recommendation and I text back saying thank you but I'm not allowed to buy individual stocks. Dial up the heat in my room and make myself a green tea in a pathetic attempt to get more natural caffeine and self-soothe. Too many emails are coming in so I get back to work answering them.

There are also a few bits and bobs like an apple, a popsicle, a cookie, etc."", '12 a.m. — What is with everyone today? Emails are rapidly coming through from two teams.

Order dinner into the office. ($25 expensed)', '6 p.m. — I finally come up for air. I\'m so mentally exhausted. Walk home and make a list of things I need to wrap up before finishing for the night. I take a quick break because I need it and eat dinner. Have a kitchen sink cookie from Dig Inn for dessert. My grandpa texts me asking how I\'m doing. He says that he hasn\'t heard from me in a while. I\'m close with my grandparents and haven\'t chatted with him since last weekend. All of a sudden, I feel like crying. I respond with one word, ""tired."" I\'m just...feeling a lot of things. I place a pickup order for a steak salad for tomorrow\'s dinner. $22', ""8 p.m. — Order a Valentine's Day Card for the boyfriend on Amazon Prime. I already bought his present a week or so ago but need a card too! $5.43"", '12 a.m. — Lights out.', 'Daily Total: $27.43', 'Day Five', ""9 a.m. — Morning! I'm woken up by my roommate having sex. Such is the roommate life. Think I drifted off to sleep around midnight last night. I wake up and run through skincare before drinking another one of the vitamin energy drinks. Delicious! One line of gratitude and then I take some time to journal. It's a gorgeous sunny day in NYC. One of those days where I wish cafes were open so that I could sit in a cute coffee shop drenched in natural sunlight. Alas, they are not. Since it's a day off, I don't wear my Apple Watch. I like the watch for how practical it is for work (never miss an email, always can respond quickly), but honestly, it's felt like a handcuff for a while. FaceTime my grandpa and whole family and slice up an apple to eat as a snack. It's really lovely just catching up with them."", '1 p.m. — Bundle up in five billion layers and go for an outdoor tennis session with a tennis partner. We chat it up, hit a bunch of rallies, and grab matcha lattes and a pastry to share afterward. She treats this time and we sit in the sun and just chat about life. Get back home and defrost. See that a cute boy from the past just texted *eye emoji* and another one from the past just Snapchatted me, what is with everyone today? Make a meal of eggs, avocado, and tandoori naan.', '5:30 p.m. — Go and pick up dinner. Subway and walk there and back. I eat dinner and honestly....it is a little disappointing. Steak is overdone and the salad is literally just lettuce. Ah well. Pretty tired.

Wish I could have slept longer until 9, since I don't feel 100% rested, but I can't seem to sleep anymore.

NYC is really grey today so I turn on my sunlight lamp for a good hour or two. Paint my nails during a break."", '12 p.m. — Make lunch! Typical ramen meal. Emails start flooding through for work so I take a 30-minute walk then start on them.', ""4 p.m. — Make a bowl of oatmeal then take a nap. Handle a few work items and head uptown to pick up some tacos from Casa Birria. I've wanted to try these out since I've seen them everywhere. THEY ARE DELICIOUS. LITERALLY SO FLAVORFUL AND THE DEPTH OF FLAVOR IS AMAZING. WOW. It's snowing hard and it makes me fall in love with the city a little more. I wonder when it'll ever feel like home here. $14"", '9 p.m. — Read a chapter of Middlesex. Browse social media. Lights out.', 'Daily Total: $14', 'Day Seven', '8 a.m. — Happy Monday! I wake up feeling pretty refreshed. Run through skincare, make a coffee, and write one line of gratitude. I read a poem yesterday that I found really beautiful, and one line really captivated me, so I copy the last stanza and line into my gratitude journal as well. ""As if you were on fire from within, the moon lives in the lining of your skin"" - Pablo Neruda. Usually, this space is dedicated to Polaroids, but since my boyfriend and I didn\'t take pictures this past weekend, I repurpose it for poetry. Find that I quite like the change. It\'s basically blizzarding in NYC today and I love the way it looks, it reminds me of home. Turn on all the lights in my room including the sunlight lamp.', ""9 a.m. — I see an emergency order banning travel, which means boyfriend can't come over tonight and chat like we thought we'd be able to...privately wonder if this means he's about to become a lover in the past tense. I really like him but can't justify having to repeat myself for a bare minimum. Inspired by Drake lyrics, I dance around my room for 20 minutes. Man, I miss clubbing and going out pre-COVID. Login to work. Look up flower arranging classes in NYC. If the breakup happens tonight, I'll take myself on Valentine's Day!"", '10:30 a.m. — A call gets put on my calendar. I reprioritize workstreams so that I am more prepared for it. I start working on a financial summary.', '11:30 a.m. — Whelp. Shit tons of work just got dumped on my face. I make and eat lunch on back-to-back calls. Take things one at a time but feel the anxiety creeping up.', '2 p.m. — Run downstairs for a quick full body weight session. Keep an eye on emails and nothing comes up. Answer urgent emails after I come back upstairs, then shower and settle back into work. Make and eat a bowl of oatmeal on the side. Lender call afterward. Send through some work items then decide to take a break.', '6 p.m. — Eat half of a spring onion pancake with some veggies and coconut aminos, then decide to make dinner early since I am hungry!!! Always happens after a weights session. I sauté chicken breast (thawed and pre-marinated from a few hours ago), frozen veggies, and pop some frozen naan into the toaster. Absolutely delicious. How do I not eat this meal more often? It literally hits all the macros and is SO BOMB.', ""9 p.m. — I have a long, exhausting call with my boyfriend after which I don't know how I feel. We're staying together for now, but it's brought up some deeper thoughts that I've always had. I feel weird about the entire situation. My dad calls and then a friend calls me after that. I finish chatting with everyone and just feel... Weird. I write down every tidbit that I can remember into a journal and just try to call it a night. Put on my favorite perfume in an attempt to self-soothe. Emails are still streaming in but hopefully, nothing I need to address will come through."", ""12 a.m. — Whelp. Work from a VP comes through. Get to work turning comments. I frankly consider just sending in my two weeks notice on the spot, but don't have the balls to do it."", ""2 a.m. — Just sent off a full deck to the managing director, but frankly I need to quit.

One of the perks of working for myself is not having to call anyone to say I'm sick. However, the guilt is real."", ""8:45 a.m. — I finally roll out of bed, gargle some Betadine, and brush my teeth. I also quickly do my morning skin-care routine, which consists of washing my face with my favorite cleanser from The Body Shop, then using my toner, vitamin C serum, Murad eye cream, and Tarte moisturizer. It's a T-shirt-and-jeans kind of day, so I hurriedly put those on, prepare coffee in my French press (which includes a generous pinch of cinnamon), and head to work."", ""9:15 a.m. — I stop to get gas on my way to the office. Living in the Middle East gives me cheap access to gas, so I don't worry much about budgeting for this. I make it to work and get down to business. I just came back from visiting my boyfriend in Paris (we are doing a long-distance relationship for now, but we are planning my move there in a few months), so I have much to catch up on at work. $10"", ""11:30 a.m. — I pack my laptop and head out to meet my friend for coffee at her office. I plan to work from home for the rest of the day, because I don't want my cold to get worse."", ""2 p.m. — My friend and I have a lot to catch up on, especially since I haven't seen her since before my trip, but I have to cut it short because my throat is acting up big-time. I go home for a homemade lunch and a nap."", '4:30 p.m. — The nap really helps, and now I feel energized enough to finish up some work. An hour later, I do the laundry and iron the clothes. I live with my parents due to culture and tradition as a non-married woman, but I carry my weight around the house; it makes me feel like I am a better adult. I then get comfortable on the couch and start season two of Mindhunter, and it knocks my socks off.', '6:30 p.m. — My stomach starts to rumble, and I am in the mood for something ""light,"" so I order a chicken shawarma sandwich and fries. $10', ""9 p.m. — My boyfriend FaceTimes me — God, I miss his handsome face. We chat for about 30 minutes, and then I continue reading Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World before going to sleep. I am a huge history buff but always feel like I don't know enough about anything, so I alternate between fiction and nonfiction books every month. I'm quite the avid reader and have surpassed my one-book-a-month New Year's resolution, as I am now on book 15 and it's only August. I'm quite proud of myself, I must say. I pop a serotonin pill and feel my eyes get heavy around 11 p.m. Good night!"", 'Daily Total: $20', 'Day Two', '7:40 a.m. — Alarm goes off! I get out of bed, wash my face, and put on my gym clothes. I am out the door by 8:15, just in time for my 8:30 yoga class.', ""9:30 a.m. — I always feel so great after leaving the gym, and this new yoga class is no exception. I am skeptical of joining new classes, because the idea of working out with a bunch of strangers gives me major anxiety, but because it's been a quiet summer at the gym, none of the classes have been crazy busy. I am relieved and excited to come back to this one next week."", ""10:15 a.m. — I decide to work outside of the office today. I feel restless, and I think it's because I just came back from such an amazing trip. Plus, I need some inspiration to work on a passion project I started putting together a while back. I started my video company three years ago and got stuck in a rut of doing nothing but client work, which means restrictive projects — clients find it difficult to think outside the box. As I have a bigger and more experienced team now, I let them handle the day-to-day clients and I try to work on the back-end admin work, as well as kickstarting some in-house productions. I ultimately want to end up making documentaries. I call my friend N., who is also self-employed, and we choose the usual coffee shop to meet up at. I order a soy ice latte and an açai bowl topped with fruits and peanut butter and get to work — but not before reading the Money Diaries! $12"", ""1:30 p.m. — I finish my work, say bye to my friend, and go to my manicure appointment. I don't usually indulge like this (yes, I consider having a manicure a form of indulgence), but I want to feel good about myself, especially since being apart from my boyfriend fills me with anxiety. It's the little methods of self-care that count, right?"", '2:30 p.m. — Nails did, girl. I go with a summer blue hue, which is quite unusual as I almost always go for black or navy blue. Even my manicurist is impressed. I pay ($30) and leave a tip ($10), then drive home. I have lunch with my parents and finish up emails/admin work. I then continue reading my book from the comfort of my couch. $40', '6 p.m. — I do laundry and water the plants around the house. My mom takes such good care of her ""babies,"" but hands over the responsibility of watering them to me when she\'s at work. I then get ready for dinner with my good friend R. I\'ve known him ever since he moved to Bahrain from Belgium for work seven years ago, and although he is twice my age, we have been really great friends ever since. He is treating me to a belated birthday dinner, and I look forward to catching up with him.', ""10 p.m. — What a fantastic and overwhelmingly great dinner! R. treated me to steak and wine, AND he got me the greatest gift possible. He's an artist, and a few years ago, he sketched a portrait of me and I made him promise me not to sell it because I was planning on saving up for it. Well, tonight he gave it to me! Framed and all. I was so moved by his generosity. He also surprised me with a little cake, too. It was worth making the exception of eating meat for him. I've strived to be a vegetarian for the longest time, so I try to eat meat no more than once a week as a first step. So far it's been easy, because I have never been a fan of meat or chicken. Fish, however, I love."", ""11 p.m. — I get home, still overwhelmed with my friend's gesture, and call my boyfriend. I fill him in on my evening and tell him how I wished he were with us. I then sit with my parents for a bit as we contemplate where to hang my gift. I tell them not to get too attached to it, because I am planning on taking it with me when I move to France in a few months. I say good night, pop a serotonin pill, and go to bed."", 'Daily Total: $52', 'Day Three', ""7:40 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I am up. I don't like hitting snooze, so waking up on the first go was a proud moment. I think the serotonin helps me wake up fresh and ready to seize the day. I brush my teeth but skip my skin-care routine, because I am hitting the gym today and I don't want to sweat all my expensive products off. I make my cold oatmeal (almond milk, chocolate chips, blueberries, almond butter, and a dash of cinnamon) and head out the door."", ""9:40 a.m. — We celebrate a fellow gym-goer's birthday today, and I spend a little extra time with her, since she is moving to Estonia soon for grad school. She's not much of a talker, and we've ironically bonded over that. We started going to this gym around the same time and have always had this silent friendship. She is strong and feisty, and I am so proud of her for just going for it! I wish her all the best in her new journey and drive to work while listening to the podcast Conspiracies and Theories."", ""2 p.m. — I leave work to pick up my dry cleaning and have lunch. Today will be my last day of eating meat and chicken. The dream is to become a vegetarian, but I have failed every time I tried, so I think transitioning to a pescatarian first will help make the shift. The dry cleaner can't find my pants, so I put on my serious face and give them 48 hours to find it. I tell them I will be back on Saturday and that I will wait in-store until I have them. Shake Shack is a five-minute drive away, so I head there to cool my nerves. I order the ShackBurger, cheese fries with bacon, and an unsweetened ice tea. Jeez, this place is so expensive, but so delicious. Farewell cheeseburgers, I will miss you. $18"", '3:30 p.m. — The AC maintenance guy is supposed to come in 30 minutes to fix my leaking AC, so I race home and shower quickly. I put on Queer Eye to cheer myself up — I have major PMS blues. My boyfriend calls me midway, and the surprise puts a smile on my face.', '5 p.m. —The AC guy never shows up. I leave him an angry message and hope he\'ll call back soon. I watch an episode of Mindhunter, then get ready to go out. My friends are hosting a non-birthday celebration for me tonight at N.\'s house. I really, really dislike birthdays and especially when they are mine, because I always feel guilty about making people do things for me. I never ask for anything for birthdays, but my friends have insisted that we all get together (it\'s been a while) for a night of beer and games. I go to my other friend W.\'s house first to pregame. He picked up ice cream for me because I hate showing up to things empty-handed, and he finally lets me pay him for it. We finish up our drink and cross the road to the ""party."" $25', ""12 a.m. — My friends know me so well; they prepared a full-on cheese board with all my favorite cheeses and ordered my favorite mac 'n' cheese from my favorite restaurant. The beer keeps flowing and we play Monikers, which keeps getting funnier and funnier with every sip. It feels so nice to be surrounded by these people, and they fill the void I feel without my boyfriend. Once the crowd starts to dissipate, my two closest friends, W. and L., and I walk to our cars, then look at each other — the look that says let's have a few more drinks at W.'s? We cross back to his, have a drink, and watch the dumbest English show ever, called Naked Attraction. It's hilarious!!!!"", '1:15 a.m. — Okay, time to head home because I miss my bed. I do my nighttime skin-care routine and lie in bed scrolling through Instagram. I eventually crawl under my blankets and pass out.', 'Daily Total: $43', 'Day Four', ""10:30 a.m. — Friyayyyyyyyy (our weekends are Friday and Saturday here in the Gulf), and the living is easy!!! I open my eyes, look at the clock, and smile — it's been so long since I slept in. Surprisingly, I don't feel guilty about it either, which is very refreshing as I feel guilty about almost everything all the time. The house is empty — my parents are out to some breakfast thing — so I start singing out loud in my T-shirt and underwear. I make coffee, load my humidifier with some essential oils, and browse the web. I like to watch documentaries on Fridays (my favorite genre of films, especially because I want to become a full-time documentary filmmaker), so I choose Child of Rage."", ""12 p.m. — Wow, that was intense. I go down an internet rabbit hole Googling the person in the film, then decide to watch something lighter, so I settle on Arch of Triumph. I love all movies set during World War II, and this one is a triple whammy because it's set in Paris AND it's in black and white."", ""1 p.m. — My boyfriend calls to update me on his latest job interview. He's so strong and inspiring, and I really just want to support him endlessly. It gets scary at times, but we have to remain strong for each other. His prospects look bright, and I reassure him that everything will be all right very soon. I then realize the time and quickly change to go to my sister's house for lunch."", '3:30 p.m. — It is so nice seeing my sister and her adorable little family. I catch up with my nephews and give them their presents from Disneyland Paris, and they love them. I head back home and decide to take a heavy nap. Friday vibes, right?', ""5:30 p.m. — Wow, I slept a lot. I am definitely getting my period, because what else would explain this exhaustion? I do the laundry, shower, and head out to my friend L.'s house for a chill night with our third musketeer. I like hanging with the boys because they are so easy and relaxed. We've known each other since forever, so the living is easy with these two."", ""7 p.m. — I pick the boys up and treat them to some bubble tea ($12.50), which I have been craving so hard lately. It's the PMS, I'm telling you. We then go back to L.'s and watch Hannibal, my favorite villain. I somehow feel bad for him toward the end of the movie. Is that also PMS, or am I just strange? My friends think it's the latter. I treat them to a simple dinner; these guys spoiled me so hard for my birthday, so this is the least I can do ($10). $22.50"", '11:30 p.m. — I get home, wash my face, apply toner and night cream, and pass OUT!', 'Daily Total: $22.50', 'Day Five', '7 a.m. — My stomach cramps wake me up. Oh look, blood! I always have a major sigh of relief when I get my period, despite being on the pill and always getting my period on time, every time. I sleepily text my boyfriend “not pregnant” and go back to sleep.', ""9:40 a.m. — I wake up to terrible news: My cousin in Kuwait just passed away. She suffered from major disabilities her entire life, and I believe she has now finally found peace; it's her parents that I feel so terrible for. I sit with my mom for a bit, then go upstairs with a cup of coffee for some web surfing and writing. I start thinking about our mortality and the soul, but decide to stop and finish watching Arch of Triumph. I go back and forth between watching the movie and checking up on my mom. Apparently, my boyfriend texted her with his condolences, and she was delighted — she already loves him so much, and everything he does is perfect to her. Best. Boyfriend. Ever."", ""1:15 p.m. — I go to my sister's house for lunch. She makes fish, which is hard to resist. I stay for an hour, then go home and get down to reading my Genghis book — I need to finish this today so I can move on to reading Hannibal tomorrow."", '5 p.m. — This book just keeps getting better and better, but I decide to leave the remaining chapter for bedtime tonight. I want to work on writing a summary of it this week, which is something I learned from my smarty-pants boyfriend, so I make a mental note of that. I then put on a face mask, shower, meditate, and watch an episode of Mindhunter.', '7 p.m. — I go downstairs to check on my mom and have dinner (leftovers, my favorite!). We both end up on the couch watching Friends, our favorite show. We have a few laughs, which I think is a great way to unwind from today. At 9, I go upstairs to read my book, and I pass out by 10:30.', 'Daily Total: $0', 'Day Six', ""4:45 a.m. — I wake up with a throbbing migraine, my long lost frenemy. I underwent a homeopathic treatment for it when I was in France back in June and haven't had one since then, which is a huge accomplishment since I had weekly migraines for 16 years. The two-month break was great, but I guess I'm having a heavy period, so this is standard. I take an Advil and try to go back to sleep. I succeed in doing so at around 6."", '7:40 a.m. — Alarm for the gym goes off. No thanks, my head is still throbbing.', ""8:45 a.m. — Okay, fine, fine, I'm up. I still have a mild headache and I can feel it in my right eye, but I force myself to face the day. I change my sheets (Sunday is bedsheet day), shower, and get ready for work. I stop by the pharmacy to buy tampons and Advil ($14) and head to the Starbucks next door for a double-shot iced latte ($5). I have my reusable cup, so brownie points for me. $19"", '10 a.m. — I make it to work and do my admin work, do a final edit of two videos, and prepare an invoice for a client.', '2 p.m. — My headache is getting worse, so it\'s definitely time to go home. I have lunch with my parents, help my mom in the kitchen, and then miraculously find her a ticket to Kuwait to attend my cousin\'s funeral. There was only one left, and obviously it\'s more important for her to go, so I help her book it, all the while thinking, “Who the hell goes to Kuwait?"" I pop two more Advils and start working on my Genghis Khan paper.', '5 p.m. — I decide to go to the gym, because the guilt of skipping it this morning is way too real. I quickly change and head out the door to make it to the 5:30 class.', ""7 p.m. — As always, I am so glad I went. Today was strength day, and I hit my record with my bench press — 38 kg! It's slow progress, but it's way better than last year! I head home, take a nice cold shower, and have leftovers for dinner. I'm still hungry, so I snack on three Oreos."", ""9 p.m. — I binge on Friends again (it always comes on TV around this time) until my headache kicks in again. I manage to get upstairs and lie in bed, too fatigued to even crawl under the covers or turn the lights off. My boyfriend calls to check in on me, and I feel immediately better. I miss his face so much. We talk for about 20 minutes, then it's lights off for me at around 10:15."", 'Daily Total: $19', 'Day Seven', ""8:30 a.m. — I slept for over 10 hours and wake up feeling refreshed. I wash my face, brush my teeth, apply vitamin C serum, moisturize, and change. It's way too hot to wear jeans, so I opt for flowy pants and a white T-shirt. I chat with my mom while I grind my coffee beans and ask her to send my condolences to my uncle, then head out the door. I stop to get gas, and since this dumb gas station only takes cash, I can only fill it with the little I have in my wallet. $8"", ""9:45 a.m. — I don't have much to do work-wise today, so I spend two hours working on my summary of the Genghis Khan book. I also dedicate 30 minutes to practicing French on Duolingo. I took private lessons for a year and a half, but my teacher goes away for the summer, so the app is the best I have right now. I must admit, I can speak French pretty well — I think I am just too shy to do so."", ""2:30 p.m. — I feel like treating myself to lunch, so I head to this deliciously healthy café and order their mac 'n' cheese and pick five items from their salad bar for dinner tonight. This place is more expensive than the rest, but you can taste the difference. I bring my lunch home and eat with my dad. It's nice to spend some alone time with him while my mom is away. $23"", '4 p.m. — I start reading Red Dragon after lunch, and it is so good. I blitz through 50 pages and decide to give my eyes a break, so I do the laundry, shower, and watch an episode of Mindhunter. L. calls me to hang out, so I get ready and head out.', ""7 p.m. — I don't like showing up empty-handed, so I stop to pick up some soda and frozen cake — it's the super cheap kind, but it's also the most delicious kind, too — sugary and buttery and cold! I make it to L.'s, where we start watching a new show called The Righteous Gemstones, and it's great. $18"", '10:30 p.m. — I make it home, brush my teeth, and text my boyfriend back and forth for about an hour.

I was responsible for all of my living/fun expenses in college.', 'Did you worry about money growing up?No. I was aware that some people had more money than us, but I never went without. My parents taught me the importance of saving, so I was able to use the money I made working to buy bigger things I wanted, like a laptop.', 'Do you worry about money now?Yes. Almost everyone I know has a double income because they are married. I try to save money and make smart decisions, but I almost always feel behind.', ""At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?I'm not sure when I truly became financially responsible for myself. I feel I have always been responsible for my own finances, but I also know I could go to my parents if I ever truly needed money for something or had an emergency."", 'Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income?

I'm freezing my eggs and have an appointment with my doctor coming up to learn how to inject myself. The medicine is all covered by my insurance except for one, which costs $3,647.60. I also pay co-pays for the other medications ($210).

They have you do an injection of saline, so you know how to “poke” yourself. It's not as bad I was expecting; the needle is really thin. I really feel lighter and less anxious leaving this appointment. No co-pay, since I didn't actually see the doctor today."", '11:30 a.m. — Head home and make a quick lunch.

My friend comes over and we walk to one of my favorite Italian restaurants. We split a bottle of red wine, pizza, calamari, and rice balls, and my half of the bill comes to $44.63.

We walk around a central London park for a couple of hours and I run down what he needs to do legally, and what I would do in the situation.

Their behavior isn't the world's greatest, but it makes the victory sweeter for me when they understand a concept.

I make a massive pesto pasta dish and convince myself that because I put mushrooms and asparagus in, I've earned the carbs. The conversation ends and my phone loads all the WhatsApp messages I've missed. One is from a great friend/FWB asking if I'm free. Um, yes?

She asks if I'm interested in anything more than the somewhat frequent nights we've been having as of late, and I'm not so sure.

We chat and flirt and generally have fun for the entire hour, but I'm slightly dubious of taking him as a client, because of legal concerns I have about the way his company operates. I explain this to him, and he offers to take me out to drinks to discuss it. Um, awkward? But sure. We make time on Friday night. We ate tons at the sushi place we are at, but he grabs the bill before I can, and tells me he'll write it off as a business expense. Fair play."", ""6 p.m. — I wait for the FWB for a ride out of the city, and we stop on the way back at our local ice rink. We both have unlimited passes and keep our skates at the rink, so it's normally a spur-of-the-moment thing. I used to skate semi-professionally and so did he. (It's how we met and became friends!)

I contemplate whilst burying myself in a massive workload, surfacing only for the occasional Haribo or KIND bar. $22.11', ""12 p.m. — A. feels sorry for me and brings me a bagel, which I scarf down while browsing Amazon. (Remember when I said I hadn't made any Random Amazon Purchases yet? Here's why I was afraid.) I buy fairy lights for my room, a star-shaped cake pan and pillows. I share an account with my mother, so I transfer her $33.53 to cover it. $33.53"", ""4 p.m. — It's been a haze of work and snack food, and I finally leave the office and head across London for more tutoring, the volunteers meeting, and drinks. I teach math for an hour, and then our meeting begins. We discuss some of the regular kids' ongoing issues, what extra support is needed, etc. We are also losing a couple of volunteers so I offer to tutor two sessions on a Thursday instead of one.

I'm beginning to feel guilty about this date tonight though. FWB is beginning to feel a lot more like BF, and I feel like a conversation might be around the corner. I decide I'll wait for him to initiate though. FWB has the day off so we head over to our fave brunch place/old haunt and get waffles with as many toppings as humanly possible. I grab the bill since he's been paying for everything recently. $43.93"", ""2:30 p.m. — We decide to make a day of it and head to a local market as we're both pretty much out of food. I buy broccoli, mushrooms, leeks, asparagus, squash, a swede, sweet potatoes avocados and garlic, as well as a freshly baked loaf of sourdough. He buys pretty much the same, but they only accept cash so he pays. Next, we head to the local supermarket and I buy juice, sprite, pasta, halloumi, black beans, almond milk and canned tomatoes. He also picks up a basketful, and I cover the cost for the both of us. We head back to mine for a little Netflix and chill. $75.96"", ""5:45 p.m. — I casually (I hope!) bring up my plans of going into London this evening for work drinks, and FWB insists I haven't crashed enough yet and suggests bailing. Though I find the suggestion sweet, I don't generally drink anyways so I know the night won't be too rough. We part ways and I jump on a train into central. Again, my card doesn't charge me for the travel and I feel super lucky right now. This may wind up being a cheaper night than I assumed!"", ""5:57 p.m. — I spoke too soon on the cheap evening front. The Bestie texts me to remind me to buy Trevor Noah tickets for his show at the O2 in six months, and I head over to the Amazon Tickets website because I have a voucher.

L. gets really drunk and keeps making super inappropriate jokes about where the evening is going to go. Even his date is embarrassed, as is the Cute Guy. I drink a lemonade, but I'm really not feeling tonight and bow out after a little shop talk.

I'm starving — and take it from a London girl — Nando's is the only place worth heading for a mammoth pile of junk food.

Life could be worse. Mindful of all he's been doing lately, I get out of bed and leg it down to the bakery around the corner, and he wakes up to fresh croissants and coffee. He's in the mood for a long, lazy lie in. I'm not opposed, but I have a bunch of work to catch up on from yesterday, so I bring my laptop into bed. $2.65"", '11:45 a.m. — I have plans for the afternoon so I ditch the laptop and put some actual clothes on.

I\'m not really an extrovert so this takes a lot coming from me. I think it came off well, but I\'m exhausted from the second I step off the stage. I thank the organizer — it is truly a great event — and head home. I can\'t resist stopping to pick up my mum\'s Christmas present from the White Company: a giant, shaggy grey throw.

She agrees, and I transfer her some cash. $26.80', ""7:30 p.m. — Dinner was amazing; FWB sure can cook! We eat asparagus, chicken, salad, and chocolate fondue with strawberries AND marshmallows. I feel like a kid again. FWB also brings up the exclusivity/dating aspect during dinner, and suggests we do a trial basis of dating, which I'm totally up for, as the main reason I didn't want to dive into this in the first place was the fact I could quite easily screw it up!

Turns out one of our biggest clients is having a mini-meltdown and everyone is heading into London now. I remember the downside to owning a startup, and try not to wake up the BF while desperately hunting down clothes. I find a pair of my jeans in the wardrobe, tuck one of the BF's white shirts into it, and pull on my converse of last night. Look in the mirror. Well, it will have to do.

It takes a few hours of reading policies, chatting with the client's other staff members over the phone, and generally calming everyone down, but eventually we get everything sorted. The client jokes we should bill her more because we had to come in on a Sunday, and we all give each other looks. I leave and find the BF waiting outside the Pret to surprise me.

It's kinda crazy, since I only broke up with my ex-boyfriend in February, and we had dated for over three years. I never felt this way about my ex — odd how timing and the heart works like that.

To have some extra money for savings and my car payment, I work 16-ish hours a week at a fancy restaurant in Minneapolis. I have a lot of former experience in hospitality, particularly working at a concierge dining club in New York back in the day, so when I decided to look for a part-time hosting position, I only wanted to work at the best in the cities. Unfortunately, as I have found over the past couple months working here, this place is pretty much smoke and mirrors, with the management and owners relying on media hype to draw the crowds in.

He is a nice guy and seems intelligent, but his habits just irk me. I feel somewhat discouraged in the meeting, because he comments on one of my annual goals, improving my coding skills, saying that my skills are “fine” enough. Meh. He then continues to share that my coworker is being promoted, meaning that I am the last traditional project-based data analyst on the team.', '12:15 p.m. — Today my dad is getting his colonoscopy. I pick him up from our designated meeting spot and drive him to his appointment (glamorous, I know). I work from the waiting room.', ""3:30 p.m. — The procedure went well!

I oblige."", ""7 p.m. — My cousin brings up that she has spoken to my mom about our fight, which started over the fact that I didn't want my mom's help moving. Her rebuttal to that was to say that I was no longer welcome at my childhood house. Really nice. (I am moving to a new apartment next week, and historically my mom has a way of making me feel worthless and like I owe her for everything, especially big things, like help moving or paying for my car insurance, etc.). My cousin says that she has never seen my mom so sad, and that makes me feel sad, but I know that in order for her to adjust her behaviors and become respectful, she needs to know how upset I am with her. My cousin just asks that I reach out relatively soon, so that the silence doesn't go on forever. It is REALLY nice getting her opinion on it, simply because I don't really have anyone else who can empathize with me — my dad refuses to talk about it, and I have no siblings."", ""8 p.m. — I leave my cousins and go to T.'s place to Netflix and chill.

As one of the three employees in charge of our company's wellness program, in my down hours at work, I help set up guest speakers or fitness-forward activities for the whole company. Today's talk is on mindfulness meditation."", '12:15 p.m. — After I introduce the speaker, I heat up leftover pizza from Monday night in our pizza oven (why there is one in the kitchen, I have no clue) and throw some Romaine and carrots on the plate for some nutrition.', ""2:30 p.m. — I have a meeting already on the calendar with my manager's manager from a while back — good timing given all the transitions lately, and my weird convo with my new manager yesterday. I express my concern about my role with the company — how do I even fit into this team anymore? And thankfully he says exactly what I hoped: I will continue to split my time between analytical prospective projects and scrum master type activities. He even shows me a presentation he will be showing to the leadership team about our team, and I am featured heavily in it for my work on a recent initiative.

I like to get a head start on work for the week, especially if I know it's going to be a busy one or if some projects just take up more time. This week is especially busy, since I'll be going to an Ariana Grande concert and Orange County over the weekend. I also just feel more productive and creative at night. I finish editing a rough cut for two videos. I upload them and set my scheduled emails to send at 7 a.m. — I don't want my clients to know that I'm up working late. I turn off my computer and wash my face. I've been using a cleanser from Shiseido lately, and it is a godsend. I go to sleep at around 3."", ""8 a.m. — I wake up and go on social media for a few minutes. I get out of bed and brush my teeth. I text my boyfriend good morning.

I go to my desk, answer some emails, and work on three videos."", ""10:30 a.m. — I eat some eggs and potatoes for a late breakfast while watching a few videos on YouTube. I check my bank account and see I just got paid from two clients. I check the setlist for tonight's concert."", ""11 a.m. — I go back to work. I finish a video that is due the next day (yay!), and I send the video to the client. I love it when I'm able to send a project earlier than its due date."", ""4:30 p.m. — I finish work early, so I shower and get dressed. I finally get to wear the Ariana Grande shirt I got from H&M. I wear a black miniskirt, a windbreaker, white sneakers, and a clear backpack (only clear bags are allowed at Ariana's concerts). I do my makeup routine."", ""6:30 p.m. — I take a Lyft to the concert ($14.47). I'm going alone because my boyfriend has to work, but I don't mind, since I really want to see her live. $14.47"", ""7:30 p.m. — I am finally inside the venue and head to get some merch.

I buy nachos and a Coke. $15"", ""9 p.m. — I look for my seat, and it's surprisingly not bad at all. Ariana starts performing, and I sing and dance along to the music — she is great live. I was nervous that I wouldn't have fun because I was going alone, but I end up having a lot of fun."", ""11 p.m. — The concert ends. I leave the venue and call a Lyft. The rates are going up because it's late and there's a lot of traffic. $30.68"", ""12 a.m. — I get home and tell my mom about the concert. I show her the T-shirt I got, and she's surprised by how many concerts Ariana has left in her tour. I wash my face, take some Advil, and go to sleep."", 'Daily Total: $100.15', 'Day Two', '9 a.m. — I overslept. I grab my phone and check my emails. I get up, brush my teeth, and shower. I get started on work.', ""12 p.m. — A package I ordered a while ago arrives. I invested in a portable light box so I don't have to set up my lights and backdrop every time I have a shoot. I am planning on using it for smaller products, like makeup. I also got a turntable to make the product videos more dimensional, as well as a new camera bag. My family brings over tacos for lunch."", '1:30 p.m. — I go back to work, editing some photos and videos and answering emails.', '6:30 p.m. — I stop working and look for something to watch on TV. I watch a little bit of Wolf of Wall Street and then a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie and Agent Carter. I keep bouncing because I keep losing interest. I eat eggs and rice, as well as chips and guac (from my kitchen) for dinner. While eating, I video chat with my boyfriend for a bit. Then I play Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros.

I wake up, get ready, and start working right away. My last automatic monthly payment installment was charged to my account overnight for my faux bangs ($22). $22', '11:30 a.m. — I make some spaghetti and mangoes for lunch and watch The Good Doctor. I usually never watch medical dramas, but this is a really good show.', ""12:45 p.m. — I go back to work and edit a few videos and answer emails. I get a package from Sephora's VIB sale — I got the Buffet serum from the Ordinary. I'm a bit scared to use this serum, because Sunday Riley's C.E.O. Vitamin C Brightening Serum didn't work out for me. I also got sunscreen from Supergoop, because I'm lacking SPF in my skin-care routine. Last, I got translucent powder from Laura Mercier, because I'm running out of powder. I don't really have much experience with powders, so I decided to use everyone's holy grail."", '7 p.m. — My dad brings home cheese pizza, so I eat three slices for dinner while watching The Good Doctor. I watch a few episodes and then go to bed.', 'Daily Total: $22', 'Day Four', ""6 a.m. — It's Thursday, and I'm happy that I woke up early. I go on social media for a few minutes before I brush my teeth and get dressed. Even though I work remotely, I try my best to get dressed right after I wake up. It helps separate my personal and work life. I even apply some lipstick or lip gloss every now and then, just to feel like I'm actually going to work. I check emails, grab some cereal, and get started on work for the day."", '12 p.m. — I eat some leftover pizza and continue working. I send a reminder to a client for overdue payment on an invoice — this happens every now and then, because freelance life.', '7 p.m. — I stop working. I try my best to stop working by 5 or 6 so I can pretend that I work a 9-to-5 job. I eat dinner with my family and then watch The Good Doctor.

I eat some cereal for breakfast, then edit and answer emails."", ""12 p.m. — I take a shower and pack my bags. I'm bringing two cameras, a Panasonic Lumix GH5 and a Canon Rebel T5i. I'll be going to a show over the weekend, and the person in charge of the show is my friend, so I want to take photos for her. I check if there are any delays today for the trains, since it's raining today — yep, it's going to be an hour late. I buy a ticket online while I'm on the site ($19). I download Lucifer, To the Bone, and Unicorn Store from Netflix on my iPad in case there's downtime. I go back to work. $19"", '3 p.m. — My dad drops me off at the train station, and I finish up some work while I wait.', ""3:30 p.m. — I hop on the train. I try to upload two short videos, but the Wi-Fi on the train is too slow. I try to use my phone data, but that doesn't work either."", '5:30 p.m. — I arrive at the other end. I work a little bit more while waiting for my boyfriend. Nothing is able to upload, so I decide to wait until we get to his apartment. My boyfriend picks me up 10 minutes later, and we jam out to BTS and Ariana Grande in the car.', ""6 p.m. — My boyfriend and I eat at a Korean BBQ place — I missed KBBQ, I haven't had it in months. We get two orders of brisket, one order of bulgogi, and mushrooms and onion. We split the check ($20.50), and I tip the waiter ($10). Then we get some boba. We get the same drink: a brown sugar milk latte with boba ($4.25). I give it a 4/5. He gives it a 3.75/5. We also go to Target to buy travel-size makeup wipes and Tic Tacs ($4). $38.75"", '9 p.m. — We head to his apartment. I catch up on work and upload the videos to send to the clients. I watch a little bit of The Good Doctor while he watches videos of classical music and guitars. I do my skin-care routine. We fall asleep. My hair smells like KBBQ.', 'Daily Total: $57.75', 'Day Six', ""6 a.m. — I wake up early to work on videos and answer some emails. Unfortunately, the internet's slow at his apartment, so it takes a while to upload videos. I take a shower, dress up, and put on skin care and makeup."", ""10:45 a.m. — We leave the apartment and go to a sandwich restaurant in a very hipster building. We both get the same thing — a sandwich with goat cheese, pesto, and a lot of other ingredients I don't remember, but it was good. I pay for the both of us ($18.65), and he buys us boba. I get a vanilla matcha latte, and he gets an Oreo mocha latte. I give mine a 3/5, and he gives his drink a 4/5. $18.65"", '12:30 p.m. — After lunch, we visit a small comic-book store and a thrift store and look around a bit. I pay for parking for the day. $4', ""1:30 p.m. — We head to a mall and window shop. We've been in the mood to shop, but we're not planning on buying anything besides macarons. We go to a macaron shop and buy four macarons. $13"", '4 p.m. — We head to Guitar Center, because my boyfriend\'s had this urge to play the guitar. There are some pretty expensive guitars there. He says he\'s afraid to touch them because they\'re so expensive and asks if I\'ve ever spent on something that pricey. I reply, ""the camera in my bag."" I encourage him to play with one, and I take videos of him.', '4:45 p.m. — We head back to his apartment to take a break. I touch up my makeup a bit. The Laura Mercier powder sets my makeup really well.', ""5:35 p.m. — We leave the apartment again and head to a cultural show at the university we both went to. My friend, who's in charge of the show, pays for our tickets (thank you!). I pay for parking. $10"", ""6 p.m. — During the pre-show, we get hungry, so my boyfriend buys us nachos and a Coke. Watching the show makes me feel very nostalgic. It was a huge part of my life when I was attending university — I performed and also was one of the show's coordinators."", '10:50 p.m. — We leave and head to In-N-Out. I order animal-style fries, a hamburger, and a small drink. He orders a hamburger and a drink and eats some of my fries. $8', '12 a.m. — We head to his apartment and knock out.', 'Daily Total: $53.65', 'Day Seven', ""8:40 a.m. — We wake up, and I do some work in the morning. I pack my things, take a shower, and get dressed. Today, I'm wearing the shirt I got from Ariana Grande's concert."", ""11:30 a.m. — My boyfriend drives me back to L.A. He and I will be having lunch with my parents since it's Mother's Day. I do my makeup while he puts gas in the car."", '12:50 p.m. — We arrive in L.A. and put my things in my apartment. My parents, boyfriend, and I head out to a restaurant for lunch. We order a lot food, including nachos, pizza, pasta, ribs, fried calamari, and mozzarella sticks. My boyfriend and I also order vanilla cream soda for both of us — so much for cutting back on soda, but we give it a 10/10. I pay for lunch. $114.83', '3:30 p.m. — We head back to my apartment and rest our stomachs. My boyfriend leaves, and my mom packs him a few snacks. I work for the rest of the day and eat pizza leftovers for dinner.', ""8 p.m. — I watch The Good Doctor — this show is really addicting. I do my skin-care routine. The serum I got from the Ordinary is working well. I haven't broken out, and I can see a difference in the texture of my skin. It's a lot smoother, and it does feel more hydrated. I hope it can help fade my acne scars. I fall asleep early."", 'Daily Total: $114.83', ""Attention, college students! What gadgets and apps got you through freshman year?

Coffee, dry shampoo, light makeup, grab a piece of fruit for later, and I\'m out the door by 7:45.', ""8:40 a.m. — Every Monday morning, I leave a few minutes early to stop at Trader Joe's on my way to work. There's a big fridge in my office pantry, so I buy ingredients to make my own lunch for the week: a bag of spring mix, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette. Five salads for the price of one at Sweetgreen! $12.04"", ""10 a.m. — About once a month, I order a big box of oatmeal to be delivered to work and have a cup for late breakfast every day. I don't get hungry until later in the morning, so I always have coffee early at home and bring fruit to have with my oatmeal mid-morning. The cost of each oatmeal cup is about 50 cents when I buy in bulk, and it leaves me full until lunch!"", ""1:30 p.m. — I take a late lunch in our courtyard with a coworker. I'm glad to have found someone who's an ice queen like me — I'm cold-blooded and love to sit outside when it's freezing. I have my TJ's salad and coffee (free from the lab). My job title is pretty ambiguous, but I'm essentially a lab/office manager at a hospital lab. After lunch, I go over a manuscript from my boss and submit it to a scientific journal for review."", ""6 p.m. — I work from 9 to 5, and go to a 6 p.m. spin class three to four times a week. I pay for an exclusive studio membership because I'm obsessed with Flywheel! I run two to three full marathons a year and do spin to supplement cross-training. I've made so many great friends here and I run outside for free on the weekend, so this expense for after-work classes is a top priority for me."", '7:30 p.m. — A friend from spin wants to grab drinks after class. We pay for our own beverages (I have a glass of pinot noir), but my friend wants to cover the fries and shishito peppers we share. I have a slice of dollar pizza on the train platform on my way home. I get back around 9:30 and start my bedtime routine. $10', ""9:15 p.m. — I have created a great bedtime routine that takes about 45 minutes: I stretch and do a quick core workout on my yoga mat, shower, moisturize my whole body, put on Crest Whitestrips while I wash dishes and clean up, and then get in bed, where I write in my journal and check up on my daily finances for my budget spreadsheet. My downfall is falling asleep to an episode of The Office that I've seen 100 times on Netflix. I don't pay for an account, but I use my sister's literally only for this bad habit!!"", 'Daily Total: $22.04', 'Day Two', ""7:30 a.m. — I physically cannot get out of bed without snoozing my alarm.

I'm so excited because winter equals clementine and pomegranate season. I run a biweekly medical research seminar on Tuesdays, so I spend the morning going over the postdoc's presentation, making sure catered lunch is on its way, and setting up the room. I end up staying for the presentation because it's in a field that I'm considering for grad school. We get free catered lunch for these seminars, so I have a goat cheese and roasted veggie wrap and save my TJ's salad for a late afternoon snack."", ""6 p.m. — Spin (prepaid with my membership) and then a trip to my favorite place... The Container Store!!! It sounds lame, but I'm obsessed. I buy a few bins that will fit under my bed to get rid of some clutter on my bookshelf. Studio life is no joke — I love it endlessly, but you really have to optimize all your storage space!! I lived off campus during college with roommates, but had saved a lot by graduation and chose to make the leap to a studio apartment. Though my parents were incredibly kind in paying for my undergrad, I worked multiple jobs throughout school and have supported myself in every aspect besides tuition and my phone bill. Living alone in Manhattan with a 40-minute commute is 100% worth the half-paycheck price, and I relish coming home to peace and quiet every night. $21.40"", ""8:30 p.m. — I get home and have TJ's vegetarian chili for dinner. I'm a pescatarian, so though I take the necessary vitamins for iron, etc., I'm always looking for more sources of protein. I top the bean and red onion chili with a squeeze of lime and shredded Unexpected Cheddar (TJ'S GOLD MINE OF CHEESE). Plus I toast a slice of sourdough to dip into it. Then I do my bedtime routine and go to sleep by 11."", 'Daily Total: $21.40', 'Day Three', ""7 a.m. — I actually get out of bed at 7:25. I am fully aware of the sleep benefits of getting up at your first alarm, but it's just never going to happen. Coffee, makeup, run a straightener through my hair, grab fruit, and leave by 8:15. On my way to work, I call my parents to catch up. I make a point to call them both at least once a week. My little sister is my absolute best friend, so we talk more often over text and FaceTime."", ""10:30 a.m. — Oatmeal and an apple for breakfast. I spend most of my day at work editing a grant proposal for my boss. I have my TJ's salad for lunch and then some pita chips I left in my desk for an afternoon snack. I take a 20-minute break after lunch to work on Duolingo — I'm fluent in Spanish and German and try to practice both daily so that I won't lose them! I also add a few lessons of High Valyrian...yes, I'm such a Thrones nerd that I am learning a completely useless fictional fantasy language."", ""6 p.m. — Day off from spin and I head to my friend's apartment for a movie night. She's making dinner, and I pick up a bottle of wine to split. We watch Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (though I've seen it a million times, as I'm a die-hard ABBA fan), and I stay to catch up after the movie. We are basically neighbors, so it's just a 10-minute walk home. I listen to an episode of another great podcast —\xa0Guys We F****d — as I do my bedtime routine. Instead of watching The Office or going to bed right away, I read Michelle Obama's new book, which just arrived in the mail! I like to utilize the library, but this was a book I knew I'd want to keep. Ugh. I miss the Obamas. $11.97"", 'Daily Total: $11.97', 'Day Four', '7 a.m. — Snooze my alarm, then have coffee. I leave a few minutes early because I have a Liquiteria coupon, and I order a half-priced Mean Green smoothie for breakfast on the way to work. $4.48', ""11 a.m. — Oatmeal. I'm a creature of habit. Today, I'm doing some general lab maintenance and meeting with our grants finance team. I get an hour lunch, so I do Duolingo after I eat my salad with coworkers. I also buy tickets for my mom and me to go to the Elton John Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour. She took me to his concert when I was younger, and I can't wait to surprise her with tickets to his last tour! I pay for nearly everything on a rewards credit card (and pay it off right away) — so I have plenty of cash back points to cover these tickets. I've had a few different cards for almost six years to build my credit score, but hate keeping a balance after the billing cycle. $425"", ""6 p.m. — I meet a friend for a quick happy hour drink and snack before a 7:30 performance of The Office! A Musical Parody. (We bought tickets awhile ago.) It is LIFE-CHANGING!!!!!!!! I cannot recommend it enough. I'm still humming the soundtrack. Incredible. $18.25"", ""10 p.m. — Get home late after the show but I'm starving, so I pop TJ's frozen spanakopita in the oven while I do my bedtime routine — minus the Whitestrips. Asleep around midnight."", 'Daily Total: $447.73', 'Day Five', ""7 a.m. — Friday!! I am out of bed by 7:10 — truly shocking. I read more of Michelle Obama's book on the train to work and am inspired to make a $20 donation to Planned Parenthood. I wish I could give more, but I like to believe that every little bit counts! $20"", ""3 p.m. — We have a weekly afternoon lab meeting every Friday and I'm presenting a new strategy to my boss today, so I scarf down my oatmeal and then my salad as I prep. Everything goes well! I love my current job, but I am looking to head back to grad school in the next few years and my bosses are very supportive of my future plans. My work friends and I take a coffee break after the meeting and discuss our upcoming skiing plans. I'm from New England, so I try to ski as often as possible on winter weekends, but it's tough when you're car-less!"", ""6 p.m. — I stop to get my eyebrows done on the way to spin. Last year for Christmas, my mom got me a yearly pass for unlimited eyebrow waxing, and I go every two weeks because my my eyebrows somehow grow at 100x the speed of the hair on my head! I tip 20% ($4). Right after spin class, I head to Trader Joe's and buy multiple cheeses, vegetarian chili, tofu, orzo, rice pilaf, avocados, pomegranates, clementines, shishito peppers, coffee, garlic parm pita chips, and cod fish ($46.21). $50.21"", ""9 p.m. — At heart I am 23 going on 40: On Friday nights, I almost always just workout, grocery shop, and then have a date night in with myself. While I'm generally somewhat extroverted, I really feel the need to take time to relax after the work week and recharge for the weekend. I make rice pilaf and cod with garlic and lemon, and then fry shishito peppers with olive oil and sea salt. I have two glasses of red wine and watch an episode of MasterChef while I eat. Then I FaceTime my sister before doing my bedtime routine, reading more of Michelle Obama's book, and falling asleep by midnight."", 'Daily Total: $70.21', 'Day Six', ""9 a.m. — I sleep in until 9 and then have a pomegranate for breakfast — messy, but worth it. I head to 10 a.m. yoga at a studio near my house. There's an amazing studio near me that's only $8 a class. I love this teacher and go two to three times a month if I have a free weekend morning. After yoga, I drop my mat at my apartment and go on a quick 30-minute run on the river. I have two half marathons and one full marathon coming up between February and April. In summer/winter, I spin more than I run, but as the races get closer, I will spin two to three days a week and run three to four with a track workout once a week and longer weekend runs. $8"", ""1 p.m. — I hop in the shower and then head to the laundromat across the street. It's $3.75 for a medium wash/dry and the machines lock, so I can set a timer on my phone and head back to my apartment while my clothes are in. While I wait, I clean my bathroom and vacuum. $3.75"", ""3 p.m. — I have an early dinner/late lunch of tofu, broccoli, and orzo with garlic salt and parmesan cheese. I always have a minimum of three cheeses in my fridge at any given time. (Currently it's feta, cheddar, and parm.) I make two portions and put the second in a plastic container for my drunk self to have later tonight."", ""6 p.m. — I'm meeting my old boss for drinks — I worked full time at a restaurant nights/weekends throughout college, and made some incredible lifelong friends there! We mean to get a glass or two of wine, but end up with three glasses of wine each and a cheese board?? Whoops. Can't have enough cheese in my opinion. I try to split the bill, but she insists it's on her."", ""9 p.m. — I stay too long at the bar and sprint to my friend's apartment nearby where I am late for game night. We play Settlers of Catan and various trivia games. I Venmo them for some wine/beer/snacks that they already bought. Then I take the train home around 11:30 and thank my past self for the leftovers in the fridge. Pass out around 12:30 a.m. sans bedtime routine. $10"", 'Daily Total: $21.75', 'Day Seven', ""10 a.m. — I don't usually sleep this late, but then again, I rarely ever stay out as late as I did last night. I have fruit, toast, and coffee for breakfast, then head out on a long run down the river."", '1 p.m. — I babysit occasionally as a side gig, and today I am picking up the girls from dance and then taking them to a birthday party — super easy. I can use the extra cash, but I also do like spending time with kids.

I then was approached by some smaller businesses to create lifestyle pieces for their websites and social media — and suddenly I realized it was something I could monetize and turn into a business.

I knew they were based in NJ, but I had assumed they were close enough to reach by Path or NJ Transit. I know better than to assume anything, and now I am feeling very disappointed in myself for not researching this beforehand. Looks like I will have to pass on this… at least I have some more work for my portfolio? Feeling frustrated, I spend 30 minutes on the stairs and 30 minutes doing some weighted ab work then call it quits."", ""3 p.m. — On my way home, I stop at Duane Reade and pick up some detergent, dish soap, Clorox wipes, razors, and a birthday card for a friend I'm seeing on Friday.

Unfortunately, it seems like the logistics won't work out, and I politely decline proceeding. Still unemployed. Feeling pangs of anxiety. Will I ever find another job? (Dramatic much?)"", ""6 p.m. — I arrive home and we quickly get ready to go meet my friends in Chelsea. I haven't seen this group in a while. They are an incredible bunch of creatives — actor, musician, performer, dancer, talent agent — and it is refreshing to be around their energy. We meet at our go-to Mexican spot. I get two margaritas while it's still happy hour, then when we move to our table, and I get a mushroom quesadilla. $31.42"", ""10:30 p.m. — We take the subway home and quickly get in bed.

She gave me some suggestions to update my résumé, which I plan to do later today. On my way out, someone calls with a potential freelance job, it sounds interesting, so I quickly shoot off my portfolio for her to forward along. I walk a few blocks and meet G. for an afternoon coffee, he pays. We walk west to a dog store to exchange a hoodie I got for my pup a few weeks ago.

G. is getting a haircut after work, so I have a few extra minutes before I need to start dinner. I run out to Duane Reade to pick up a box of pasta and cheese, I have sauce from the grocery delivery on Sunday. $6.78', ""7 p.m. — G. comes home with the coolest bouquet of flowers!

Once he's gone, I am way too cold to sit at my desk, so I grab my laptop, get back under the covers, and browse job postings from the warmth of my bed."", '1 p.m. — Okay, this is getting ridiculous. I finally pry myself out of bed, walk the dog, and get out of the house. I need to get my friend a birthday gift since I am finally seeing her tonight (her birthday was a few weeks ago!). She is a really great gift giver so I am feeling the pressure. I walk over to 10 Corso Como. I find the best little purple glass jar that I think she will love.

Totally extra, but totally appropriate for the evening. G. and I are going with my other best friend, D., and her boyfriend. D. and I decided earlier this week to go full glam this evening, so I do a full face of makeup. On our way to the restaurant, we pick up a small congratulatory bouquet for E.

Time to tap into my PR contacts and see if I can score some free media dinners in exchange for coverage. I know this is not the most ethical approach to journalism, but the publication I work for doesn't cover my food spending, so I have to be resourceful to avoid spending all my budget on eating out. I email a few PR peeps and hope for the best."", '1 p.m. — Start to get hungry, and I head to my fridge to consider my options.

I make a salad with arugula, feta cheese, tomatoes, bean sprouts, cauliflower rice, and canned tuna, and have a coconut popsicle for dessert.', ""1:15 p.m. — Mid-salad, I realize that I'm late for a phone interview with a chef for a big article that I'm working on.

I remind myself that this is Miami, and people are rarely on time for meetings anyway."", ""1:35 p.m. — Well, that was awkward!

It's not even fall yet, but it is their anniversary sale, so I end up getting it for $100 less than the regular price.

Despite what many people told me before I left New York, Indian food is the only thing I've eaten here that hasn't made me sick at all. The boys offer to cover my bill, so I buy us chocolate paan for dessert ($0.44). We head home, and I collect my clothes, Uber back to the hotel ($1.35), and pass out after a quick call to my parents. $1.79"", 'Daily Total: $89.65', 'Day Two', ""8:10 a.m. — I make a mad dash to breakfast — I'm running late this morning! I had an early FaceTime call with my ex, who is currently interning in D.C. We had a pretty excruciating breakup a few months ago but time and a LOT of honest communication have allowed us to remain in each other's lives as great friends (this is the only time this has ever worked for me). We catch up for a while and discuss the myriad experiences we're having this summer. He's one of the few people I can be completely open with, which I'm always thankful for."", ""11 a.m. — Phew! We take a much-needed coffee break at work. I'm a full-stack software developer, but I have limited experience in computer science, so pretty much all of my energy during the workday goes into focusing hard on our training material. I'm not going to lie, it's really hard, but this is my first big girl job, and if I'm going to make a name for myself in the industry, especially as a woman in tech, then I need to work my butt off. My friend, J., also helps me out a ton — he's a great coder and is always willing to answer my questions."", ""12:45 p.m. — We head upstairs for lunch. I order Chinese cauliflower with rice followed by a golden latte and coconut cookies. This is my go-to meal (though after India I doubt I'll be able to bring myself to buy a trendy $7 latte at a coffee shop ever again). All of us sit at a long table and reminisce about this weekend's festivities. Then we take a brief walk outside; the weather in Bangalore is akin to California, so even though it's monsoon season, it's usually 80 degrees and breezy. $1.23"", ""4:10 p.m. — I get off work early and race home to the hotel; it's across the road from the office. One of my Indian coworkers, S., texts to tell me I left my laptop charger and asks if I want it now or if he should hold onto it until tomorrow. I reply with the latter, since I need to decompress. A note about S.: I've been getting vibes from him, and a friend confirmed he's into me, but it's been slow-going. I don't know whether to chalk this up to cultural differences (according to my friends, people are still getting used to dating as a concept in general in even the more cosmopolitan areas of India) or if he's just shy — probably both — and I really do find him quite cute, but also if he doesn't make a move soon, I know I'm going to lose interest. I need a sign from the universe!"", ""5:30 p.m. — I order chicken spring rolls from room service as a snack/early dinner. Most of the food here is very carb- and fiber-heavy, so I typically have a light dinner or skip it altogether if I'm still full from lunch. Room service is convenient, but I really miss cooking. The rolls arrive, and I chow down, sip on wine, and listen to my favorite podcast, The High Low. $5.62"", ""6:30 p.m. — Meet up with three of my coworkers in the hotel lobby and walk to the mall across the street to go see Mission Impossible: Fallout. We get tickets for the cushy recliner seats in the back of the theater and I buy mixed cheddar and caramel popcorn — my favorite!! The movie is okay, but it does include lots of Paris scenery and I spend the first half of the film trying to see how many places I can identify onscreen. A fun fact about going to the movies in India is that the national anthem is played before each film, and there's an intermission like they had in the early days of movie theaters. We head back home after the movie. $10.05"", 'Daily Total: $16.90', 'Day Three', ""7:25 a.m. — It's payday!!! My colleagues and I decide to go out to celebrate tonight and I get ready for work while dancing to my morning playlist and feeling generally good, despite the fact that I stayed up too late. I've been trying to slowly introduce brushing my teeth with sink water instead of bottled water because it's more sustainable and less of a nuisance. I had some stomach issues last night but I feel a little better this morning. Is this a bad idea? Probably, but clearly I'm willing to subject my stomach to risky situations in the name of curiosity (read: laziness)."", ""9:45 a.m. — My paycheck is here! As much as I like getting paid, I LOVE budgeting and try to track every single purchase (spreadsheets give me life). I browse the shoe section on Yoox for a while because I feel like treating myself but end up not buying anything as 1) I can't wear the shoes here and 2) tonight's dinner is going to be relatively expensive. I opened a checking account for my fixed expenses instead and will transfer over money when I need to pay for my apartment in NYC."", ""1 p.m. — Head to the cafeteria and order paneer makhani (sooo good) with mushrooms. I discuss what I'm going to cook with some of the guys at their house this week. As we're leaving, S., who lives in the house, suggests we go grocery shopping together before I make dinner, and I say yes. It'll be the first time we've actually hung out alone. Is the universe working in my favor after all? $1.02"", ""4:40 p.m. — I leave work and go back to my hotel room to take a bath before we go out for the evening. I take a bath almost every day — it's my number one way to relax. I shave my legs (it's been quite a while), since the restaurant we're going to tonight has an infinity pool."", ""6:20 p.m. — I call us an Uber over to the mall where the restaurant is ($0.92) and end up having to turn on my phone to text some of our coworkers who are meeting up with us because I can't get on the mall's wifi ($10). I'm a bit peeved about this but forget about it when we take the elevator up to the roof — it's SO beautiful. You can see all of Bangalore from here! Unfortunately, it turns out the pool is part of the hotel on top of the mall, not the restaurant itself, and it's about $10 to swim in it, so I (very reluctantly) pass on going in. $10.92"", ""7:15 p.m. — I order two mojitos, a double Jägerbomb, and mac and cheese with shrimp and truffle oil (it brings a tear to my eye just thinking about how delicious that sounds), and eat a bit of the meat platter we ordered as well. I eat mostly vegetarian, and I forgot how fast meat fills you up! We spend the evening joking around and dancing — the DJ at this place is surprisingly good — and it almost feels like we're back at home in New York, even if only for a little bit. I have consistently laughed and had more fun in the past month of this job than I have in a long time, and I'm truly grateful for the friends I've made here. $60.61"", ""9:30 p.m. — The gang splits up; half our group goes to another restaurant to get post-drinking pizza, one friend goes home and I pay for his Uber since he doesn't have cell service ($1.45), then I walk with our friends back to their house to hang out. On the walk, S. and I discuss places in Bangalore we've visited — most of our Indian friends are new here as well — and after gushing over how much I liked the Lalbagh Botanical Gardens, he suggests we go together next week. I say yes and he clarifies with: “just the two of us” (!!). I'm happy he finally asked me out. Back at the house, my coworker, K., and I chow down on aloo paratha and discuss the cultural differences between India and the U.S. with everyone. I start yawning after about two hours and order us an Uber home ($1.45), where I proceed to crash immediately. If you haven't guessed by now, Uber is extraordinarily inexpensive in India. $2.90"", 'Daily Total: $75.45', 'Day Four', ""8:30 a.m. — I really struggled to wake up today; for some reason I haven't been sleeping that well this week. At work, I surf Amazon and decide to buy an alarm clock to wake me up — using my phone in the morning gives me brain fog and I end up scrolling through Instagram/Snapchat for too long. Maybe I should just delete them?? I've done it before but I always come crawling back. $8.32"", ""12:30 p.m. — Not much is really happening today. I know I need to study really badly after work, and I'm already dreading it. At lunch I have a paneer and dahl combo with naan. I eat pretty quickly and head back to our classroom so I can look over the training material during the break. $1.02"", ""3:50 p.m. — We take a tea break, and my friends and I spend it chatting with our trainer, who is at least 40 but also a high-key dreamboat. My sister FaceTimes me randomly (it's 6:20 a.m. where she is in the U.S.), and we chat — she's feeling sick and can't go back to sleep. She's a lot younger than me, but we're really close, and I hate that we can't talk more due to our 9.5-hour time difference."", ""6:30 p.m. — Wow, I will do anything to procrastinate! Instead of studying I clean my room, work on my budget, and watch two episodes of The Alienist (highly recommend). I realize I'm craving some me time — one of my favorite things to do in New York is wander around outside with my headphones in. However, it's not safe to do that here, so I go across the street to Big Bazaar (like the Target of India) and peruse the aisles while listening to Call Your Girlfriend for almost an hour before getting things I actually want. I buy a tank top, palazzo pants, a hairbrush and straightener, rosewater spray, hair serum, mango juice, bananas, yogurt, butter rusk, and cheese spread. At the cash register I try to work on my Hindi with the cashier — it's slow-going, but I really want to get better, as speaking it makes life a lot easier here. $41.76"", ""9:45 p.m. — I get back home and put away my purchases while listening to an advanced Java lecture on YouTube. I'm slowly starting to get it (yay, progress!), and I fall asleep halfway into the talk."", 'Daily Total: $51.10', 'Day Five', ""7:20 a.m. — I'm doing my hair, courtesy of my straightener impulse buy from last night (I have curly hair and very rarely style it) and the power goes out in my room. Panic ensues for the next five minutes until, miraculously, the lights come back on. I can proceed with the day without looking like I have a lion's mane!"", ""10 a.m. — At work today we're training on high-level Java concepts (most of the words I've never even heard before) and even though I understand the theory, I'm struggling to get the syntax to actually code it. Instead, I make a spreadsheet detailing how much my coworkers owe me from our dinner at the rooftop bar the other night (I picked up the bill, again, for the credit card points). I share it with my friends and everyone Venmos me."", '12:45 p.m. — I head upstairs for a quick lunch of chole bature before going across the street to the hotel. I clean a bit (S. and I are going to the grocery store after work but will have to stop by my room first) and grab a dark chocolate bar with orange peel to pass around in training this afternoon. $0.87', ""3:20 p.m. — Work is still dragging! In between coding lectures, I spend most of my afternoon looking at NYC apartments on Zillow and StreetEasy. I've committed to two apartments so far and then had them fall through. I'm really happy I finally found a friend who is also new to the city and is committed to finding a place. I send her two-bedroom options that look promising."", ""4:30 p.m. — Free at last! S. and I walk over to the hotel. He waits in the lobby while I change, because it's too much trouble to get him registered as a guest who can go upstairs. Our hotel has a very strict policy when it comes to guests, but especially ones of the opposite sex. It can feel very oppressive sometimes — sexuality (and, by default, open conversations about it) is notably absent in public life in Bangalore as compared to everyday life in the U.S. — but I can't complain, since I stay here for free."", ""5:20 p.m. — S. and I finish up our grocery shopping at Big Bazaar. I'm planning on making Southern American food for the guys — I'm from the South — but we have to improvise a bit since certain ingredients aren't at the store. At checkout, S. insists on paying, and says the guys will split the bill since I'm cooking. We share the cost of an auto rickshaw back to the house and end up getting caught in the rain and subsequent traffic. I don't really mind, since it allows us to chat while we wait. When we get to their house, the power is out, so I nap while waiting for it to come back on so we can get started making dinner. $0.73"", ""10:15 p.m. — Things are going well in the kitchen! I have to improvise a bit and end up making Indian-style Southern food. The boys, two of my American coworkers, and I gather around in the living room to eat spicy tomato and okra stew and cheesy dahl (lentils) with paneer. I whip up pancakes with homemade mango syrup for dessert. I'm exhausted from cooking, and we all sit in a food coma afterwards and listen to one of our friends play the drums, then head home a little after midnight."", 'Daily Total: $1.60', 'Day Six', ""7:30 a.m. — I take my time getting ready this morning. I've gotten really into skincare in the past few months (for a long time, my only products were soap and coconut oil) and I'm loving the rosewater spray I bought. It's not Mario Badescu, but for how cheap it is, it really does the trick. On the way out of breakfast I snag a coffee mug to take to work — we only have tiny paper cups to use with the office espresso machine."", ""1 p.m. — While going to lunch, I stop at the ATM in the office and get out cash for our trip to Punjab this weekend. The ATM fee ($8.08) is a bit steep, so I typically take out a lot of cash at once, but it's worth it because I'm so excited! Punjab is in the northernmost area of India (on the border with Pakistan) and one of my coworkers, P., has family there, so they're taking all of us around for the weekend. I take my rupees and head to the mall across the street, where I get lunch at Subway and an Oreo McFlurry for dessert before hurrying back to the office. $12.94"", '5 p.m. — After work, I take a bubble bath and order shrimp alfredo from room service for dinner. I spend most of the evening watching Jimmy Fallon videos and not packing (oops). I should clean my room, but I end up just laying in bed in the air conditioning until I scramble to pack 10 minutes before we have to meet in the lobby to leave for the airport. $7.24', ""8:10 p.m. — All 10 of us meet in the lobby; there are no Uber XLs floating around, so we split three different cars to get us to the airport on time ($5.53). I turn on my cell service so my parents can know where I am since I'm traveling (I Venmo them $20 for the two days I'll be using it), and I text with S. during the hour-long ride. Our dynamic has definitely changed after Thursday night — it feels more comfortable and natural. Once we get through security, I buy drinks (there's real orange juice here!!) for the flight ($4.96), and we board our flight to Delhi, where we have a connection to our final destination, Amritsar. $30.49"", 'Daily Total: $50.67', 'Day Seven', ""3 a.m. — We're hanging out in the Delhi airport for our 5:15 a.m. flight. Half of us are sleeping and the other half are exploring. I pick up cashew cookies ($0.44) at a snack shop and my friend and I split a combo from Pizza Hut ($4.97). The pizza is really not that good. $5.41"", ""4:45 a.m. — While waiting to board, my friend notices an older man taking photos of her and our other friend as they're sitting at the gate. He then shows the photos to two of his other friends, and my friend is fuming. He leaves but soon returns, and she proceeds to tell him off in Hindi. He immediately dismisses my friend, telling her not to make a scene, which only makes her angrier, and by the time security comes over to investigate, they are both shouting at each other. CCTV footage shows P. is right, but the men refuse to apologize and we board the plane without confirmation that the photos have been deleted. India is one of the lowest-ranked countries for gender equality in the world, but we've been lucky to have not experienced much of that until now. It's an upsetting reminder that even in the metro parts of India, women still face serious discrimination."", ""7 a.m. — We meet P.'s family outside of the Amritsar airport. It is HOT here. Immediately, we all drive off to see the Golden Temple. It's the most significant Sikh shrine, and it's stunningly beautiful. P.'s dad has a connection and we get to skip the entire line — it's about a four-hour wait — and walk through the temple. Afterwards we ride in a real (horse-drawn) rickshaw to the car and bask in the air conditioning on the way to eat breakfast."", ""11 a.m. — After a breakfast of the best chole bature and chai I've ever had, we visit an old-style Punjabi town. At a restaurant nearby, I have amazing sweet lassi, and P.'s sister and I escape to hang out in the air-conditioned bathroom for relief from the heat."", '3:20 p.m. — We drive to the Wagah (India/Pakistan border) to watch the ceremony that happens there at sundown. We all nap (none of us really slept last night) while waiting.', ""7 p.m. — We're sitting in a giant stadium to watch the border ceremony — it's a demonstration of Indian national pride as well as a show of keeping the peace with Pakistan. The energy is crazy! It feels like a giant party, pep rally, and military parade all combined into one, and any tiredness we were feeling before dissipates in the hype going on around us."", ""8:40 p.m. — We're on the road to P.'s family's house about two hours from Amritsar. Everyone is completely exhausted from traveling and the excitement of the day. It feels really nice to be with someone's family, and it makes me miss my own. I order thongs on the Amazon app (I have a somewhat-confirmed hypothesis that they are extremely difficult to purchase in India) and fall asleep snuggled up to my travel pillow. $19.95"", 'Daily Total: $25.36', ""Money Diaries are meant to reflect individual women's experiences and do not necessarily reflect Refinery29's point of view.
